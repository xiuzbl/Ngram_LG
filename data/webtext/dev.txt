The Department of Homeland Security recently issued a chilling report: Americans, it said, can expect an upsurge in "rightwing extremism" from White nationalists, militias, and groups like the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan, of course, has had a hand in some of the nation's most infamous acts of racial terror and murder. But what does the KKK look like today? Photographer Anthony Karen has documented the modern-day Klan in their homes, at rallies, and at Klan gatherings, taking us deep inside a world we would otherwise never see -- a world most of us might not even want to know about. The unnerving photos featured here, exclusively on LIFE.com, are from his new book, "The Invisible Empire: Ku Klux Klan." "The majority of people I've come across," Karen told LIFE, "you'd only know they were in the Klan if they decided to share that."

Dropbox and Google Drive are very different services that appeal to different users. While Drive is connected to the entire Google Apps (now known as G Suite) ecosystem, Dropbox is a lightweight, simple alternative for file storage. While both are useful, users need to look beyond features, and make sure the service they choose can adequately protect their data. Here's how Dropbox encryption and Google Drive encryption stack up.

So, welcome to doom - 1994! - May 18, 1994 to be exact. A time when even doom 2 hadn't been released (I know - hard to beleive). It's not that I don't have enough reviews to do or anything but i had this itch to do something different. I was looking through some of the old maps I had already reviewed on the site and it came to me that maybe I could review something that came out before there were review sites. the journey of my thoughts led me to choosing something that was turning 20 years old! this one will be exactly 20 years old within hours of me posting this review. - i looked through a bunch and this one looked interesting! and it is! i hope you enjoy playing it as much as i did. and, it finally gets a review after all these years. Peter, wherever you may be today - good job!

The Jeep Wrangler is already one of the best off-road vehicles on the market, but Thaler Design will help turn your Wrangler Unlimited into the ultimate off-road RV with its ActionCamper kit. The Austrian company adds a fiberglass camper shell featuring a pop-up soft top with enough space for a two-person weekend adventure. Even better, the top is removable (with very heavy lifting required) and it only adds a net 440 pounds to the Wrangler's curb weight after components such as the factory top, rear doors, rear seat and roll bars are all removed.With the styling of an old military ambulance, the ActionCamper is about everything you need for a short off-road excursion, including a plenty of storage space, a refrigerator, stove, toilet and sink. The camper comes with a four-gallon fresh-water tank as well as a black-water (sewage/drainage) tank that can hold 5.5 gallons. The extendable nozzle from the sink can also be used as a shower. There's also a fold-out king-size bed and, with the top popped, you get enough room in the kitchen/sitting area for a six-foot, three-inch person to stand up. GizMag says the ActionCamper has a retail price of $53,500 , not including the donor Jeep . That's serious money but it's still cheaper than the survivalists' special Earthroamer XV-JP

**Wall of text ahead! Due to the complexity of Physx and the amount of research I have spent trying to fix this issue, This is going to be a very long post. To Skip to how you can help, find the line that starts with "Instructions", Otherwise, sip some coffee , read on and maybe get a better understanding of Physx** -------- **Introduction** Hey reddit, I understand not everyone here has Borderlands 2/TPS but something needs to be done about the performance of PhysX in Borderlands 2/TPS and that's what my goal is. I have spent the last 4 weeks doing a ton of research into the way Physx works and the CPU/GPU utilization aspect. Ideally I would like to hire someone to work on the Physx aspect of the game since i am not proficient in coding, and in the meantime, I am learning how to do this myself. Specifically, I want someone to decode and edit the .dll and the .bin files in the game directory and change any calls or strings and maybe some float lines to make fluid and particle effects work better on multi threaded hardware. The end goal is for me and everyone else to finally have a fix for the low fps when Physx is being utilised. I will be updating this thread as I come across more info. I believe some of the .dll and .bin files in the game directory hold the code that is overriding any important INI tweaks that are made. I want to change the lifetime of particles AND SPH fluid effects since no physx ini tweaks work besides "MaxParticleResize". Eventually If I come up with a tweak that fixes Physx for me, I will release it to everyone else so our FPS can stop being held down. **Background** Back in 2013, I had a GTX 680 classified and a I7 920 @ 4.4GHz. I was able to run Borderlands 2 with no problem 60 + fps on the highest settings while on 1920 X 1080. Fast forward to now, I have a GTX 1080 Classified oc'd with a I7 5930k oc'd to 4.6ghz and I am unable to maintain that same 60fps @1920 x 1080 with better hardware while fluid and particle effects are being used. It's most evident in, but jot limited to Bloodshot Stronghold when I am using my DP Unkempt Harold(DPUH) and fighting enemies with fluid effects around while the DPUH is kicking up solid particles. My FPS is 120 when there is no liquid or particles. I have used a lot of ini tweaks but none of the important ones work besides maxparticleresize but that does not affect the lifetime of the particles or the fluid effects. I find it unacceptable to lower or disable Physx as IMO it adds a lot to the game in terms of things like oh...you know...fun. I'm seeing posts all over the Web on how people with triple sli 980s, and dual titan setups are having the same problem. Neither Gearbox or Nvidia are working on fixing this issue so I feel it's time to do something about this and I am going to try my best to get physx working as it should because this is my favorite game. If this works for Borderlands 2, I will try to optimize The Pre-Sequel as well. I want to get an idea of what the physx indicator is telling people when they are in game standing still and then while heavy particle and fluid effects are being used. Just from some google searches, Some people have been reporting that the Physx visual indicator is reporting GPU and some saying CPU. Mine, for instance does not show Physx - GPU even though I have mine set to use my GTX 1080 Classified. Also, a lot of people who are using monitoring software are reporting very low CPU/GPU usage even when physx effects are intense. Back during release, Nvidia and Gearbox boasted that the Physx runs great on Borderlands 2 and that we wouldnt have the issues we at undressed having now. It's not like it's a month after release. The game came out 5 years ago. I think it's safe to say we won't be getting help from anyone at Nvidia or gearbox. [Here](http://physxinfo.com/news/9425/borderlands-2-is-cpu-capable-of-handling-the-physx-effects/) is a very interesting article about physx in Borderlands 2. It's from PhysxInfo.com and apparently the person (Zogrim) who made the article spoke to the devs that worked on Physx and this is what he had to say. "First thing I did after the release – I have asked the PhysX content team, who has worked with Borderlands, if game using APEX – it is not. Just default PhysX Cloth and PhysX Particle System implementations. So those settings have no use" **Instructions** This is the part where YOU can help me figure

Today, we're going to be looking at a general overview of the Paragon heroes and which heroes/champions/gods from other MOBA's they best compare to. Sometimes there are obvious comparisons between two characters, but other times there aren't direct analogs in other MOBA's so we're going to offer a short description justifying how they match in terms of design.

SOMETIMES things are not what they seem. Beneath the surfaces of Walter Hill's noisy biker musical Streets of Fire and John Boorman's urban thriller Point Blank are themes derived from the Arthurian cycle and the Grail romances. Ron Howard's Willow and George Miller's Mad Max series both draw on the kitty of motifs provided by The Hero with a Thousand Faces, a scholarly work of comparative mythology by the late Joseph Campbell. And sometimes the inspiration for popular shows can be even more recondite, as in the case of Twin Peaks, now departed from our screens but - as proved by the Japanese craze for Peaks holidays reported earlier this week in The Independent - certainly not forgotten.

I wrote last week that the ACC is currently on its deathbed, largely because of the conference's poorly renegotiated TV deal with ESPN. My claim provoked an impassioned reaction from commenters on both sides of the debate, and many readers offered detailed and thoughtful responses. But some of those comments also made it apparent that there is a fair amount of confusion regarding the details of the conference's television rights, particularly third tier rights, and what impact they will likely have on the conference's future.

Release: Q4, 2000 - Genre: Sports, duh - Console: PS1, PS2, DC, N64, GBC Now here's a game that I can't imagine too many people own on purpose... and yet, here I am with a copy to review. Basically, what you have here is a collection of simple minigames themed around Olympic sports. You can play the games with up to three other players (multitap required, even though most games have you taking turns anyway) or alone and compete for high scores, either one at a time in trial mode, or all in a row with championship mode. That's the entirety of the game and it offers literally minutes of fun, trust me. But before we get into the details of each game, I would like to say that this game did impress me in two ways (and only two ways). Firstly, the character animations are actually impressively good for the time this was made. Apparently they were motion captured, if the back of the box is to be believed. Second, there are really smooth text introductions to each event which are animated according to the sport; for example, 100m Hurdles has the words jumping over each other... so that's cute, I guess.  In general though, the gameplay is simple, boring, and sometimes unclear. Worse, unlike real sports or other sports games, each minigame offers little room for improvement after you've mastered it, which will only take a couple of attempts. Honestly, I could probably just end the review here, but I'm sure you'd all like to see how these minigames are, so... 100m Dash

Analysis: Is it time to get worried about the banks?
GQ magazine named Colin Kaepernick its "citizen of the year" for his launching the last year of NFL kneeling protests. The magazine noted that Kaepernick refused to be interviewed for the cover article, explaining, "As his public identity has begun to shift from football star to embattled activist, he has grown wise to the power of his silence." Seeking to suggest that Kaepernick is sacrificing himself for the cause, GQ quotes rapper J. Cole, who states, "Had [Kaepernick not taken a knee], this guy would be making millions of dollars right now. Period, point blank. And more important than the money, he was living his dream. He sacrificed his dream." World's smallest violin, please.

The GOP are reaching the pinnacle of the decades-long plan to take control of US government and its institutions. Having successfully taken over the federal legislature through a combination of gerrymandering, alleged voter suppression, and the leveraging of partisan politics, the Republican party have captured 32 state legislatures and (as of this week) 32 governorships, stacked the Supreme Court in their favour (thanks in part to the year-long obstruction of a vote on Merrick Garland), and primed huge swathes of their base to never consider crossing the aisle to vote Democrat. The 2016 Presidential election would have been their crowning glory, granting them control over the three branches of federal government, but the election Donald Trump has seen their work begin to unravel.

On a scale of "Christmas presents bought at Walmart" and "Christmas presents bought at Cartier," where does Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Christmas Gift Guide fall? I think you know the answer to that. But here's the thing – I never really find crazy-expensive gift guides all that offensive. I actually enjoy looking through some of the pricier gift guides and saying to myself, "Well, of course I should give my mother a $5000 gold-plated juicer, who wouldn't?" Expensive and "aspirational" gift guides for the 1% are amusing and interesting, because rich people spend stupid money on stupid things. What I find offensive is when Gwyneth does her "fall/spring fashion guides," which is where she tells people that they should be spending $45,000 on new clothes per season. But anyway… people are making a big deal about this week's Goop-letter, in which Gwyneth recommends $109,384 worth of crap including:

Extra perspective is always a good thing. While we strive to spend a good bit of time in reviewing a phone, nothing quite gives you a full impression of a phone like using it day-in and day-out for weeks and months on end. The Galaxy Note 5 really won us (and many others, from the looks of it) over in our first evaluation of it — and again after two months — and now that we've reached the six month point since launch it's worth yet another revisit. It's fair to say right from the start that this big phone has held up over time, but what about the finer points of the experience? That's what we're here to evaluate.

DW Forum - Thanks Tom for coming here and spending some time with us. Tom Bleecker - Thanks for having me here DM. DW Forum - Do you think Bruce saw his death coming? Tom Bleecker - It appears that he did. Remember, he did tell Linda a few weeks before he died that he "didn't think that he would live as long as she because he couldn't keep this up much longer." DW Forum - Was Bruce Lee beaten up on July 20th 1973, no way medicine can do that to your face. he was posioned, went to bed, then beaten up, then they put his clothes on and forget about his second show? Also his body is not really buried in seattle? Tom Bleecker - I seriously doubt that Bruce as beaten up on July 20th. The swelling of his face is not uncommon. Compare Bruce's face to that of Elvis Presley. The swelling was caused by retention of water, in his face and his brain. DW Forum - Just before Brandon died he claimed that he has evidence about the real death of his father is this true?Do you know more about it?? Tom Bleecker - I have heard that Brandon had made a public statement that he intended on reopening the investigation of his father's death after he (Brandon) finished filming "The Crow." When I was married to Linda, Brandon often came to the house to sit in what I called "The Bruce Lee Room" and read over his father's files. DW Forum - Was Bruce given poison by his herbalist and this caused his death? Tom Bleecker - Certainly a strong possibility. DW Forum - To ask a expert as yourself only one question is very hard so I put my question like this .Here a rough run down on a few points, can you tell me if I am off track or close ? Bruce was a legal resident of the County of Los Angeles , state of California at the time of his death ( this is strange but I reading it for a legal document) After his death his estate was valued at 2,797,351.00 $US dollars. Bruce's assets were in Wu Ngan name and after Bruce's passing Wu Ngan recieved a large sum of money from Linda's lawyer to sort this out and quicky disappeared and returned to England. In 1974 two Insurance companys only payed half of the amount on the polices and were unable to obtain a copy of the Autopsy report , not because of what it included but what was missing in the report pointed to something much more ... There was a big row the night before Lee died with Raymond Chow over the business accounts and even after Bruce's passing the were problems over the rights to Enter the Dragon. Bruce is not buried in Seattle. Bruce's body was in an unusual conidition not link to the offical story of his passing. Betty Ting Pei a few years after Lee's passing gave some of Bruce's clothes to a famous Hong Kong comedian. Both the HK police and insurance company invesagated Lee's drug connections and quietly closed the case. Raymond Chow about to lose the biggest part of his business so he had Bruce poisioned though his drug use (cannabis) unable to prove this , and because of Chow past connections to the Taiwan Grove, something like the C.I.A. , Linda and Marshall closed the book on the case and got as much of the money from the insurance company as they could for Linda and the kids. Tom Bleecker - I didn't see a question in your post. That said, I do agree with most, or all, of what you posted. Please email me sometime at your convenience, and I can share some things that were not in UM. Incidentally, I would like to purchase a copy of your book if you will give me a link. DW Forum - Regarding your time spent in Hong Kong for Unsettled Matters, were you able to speak with Betty about July 20th or was she unavailable at the time? She does seem more candid than the rest of the lot there. Perhaps her conscience and love for Bruce,it seems. Although like the others, she spun a few white lies as to her whereabouts on 7/20, a short time later, she seemed to open the door more than anyone else would have been willing to.I still find it hard to believe there are some who refuse to believe that there was a love affair going on between them, no big deal it happens to many,actors and non actors alike. I wonder what she is recollecting on this day in Hong Kong? I would think today,the press is having quite a time with her. Tom Bleecker - There is no question but that Bruce and Betty had an ongoing love affair, and you're right, it isn't all that uncommon, inside and outside Hollywood. Yes, I have talked with Betty, and I found her to be honest and down to earth. And yes, she did have a great love for Bruce. DW Forum -
A young woman who went to her bank to reset her PIN number was refused service after staff said her appearance didn't match her ID's. Feifei (alias) forgot the card's PIN after a long period without using it, and so took her photo ID with her to the Xihu branch of China Construction Bank in Shaoyang to sort things out. However, she was now 7kg lighter and had a different haircut compared to when she had her ID photo taken in 2009, a time at which she weighed 54kg and sported a sloping fringe. Her bank has told her to get a new ID from her local police station. One netizen said the bank was just doing it's duty.

Matches Malone was a New Jersey gangster and arsonist whose identity was taken by Batman after his death. Batman uses his street credibility to gain intelligence on criminal organizations he would not otherwise be able to infiltrate. This also acts as a way of providing redemption for a man that Batman believes wasn't all that bad. The nickname "Matches" comes from his habit of constantly keeping a match in his teeth. In the Prime Earth continuity, Batman has been seen using the Matches Malone identity, but it is unknown if there was a real Malone. Matches Malone was created by Dennis O'Neil and Irv Novick, first appearing in Batman #242. (1972)

Ever since the UPA government mooted the Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project (SSCP) in 2004, it has been a target of criticism from environmental advocates as well as religious enthusiasts.

Abstract : Dairy foods contain complex nutrients which interact with the host. Yet, evolution of lactase persistence has divided the human species into those that can or cannot digest lactose in adulthood. Such a ubiquitous trait has differential effects on humanity. The literature is reviewed to explore how the divide affects lactose handling by lactase non persistent persons. There are two basic differences in digesters. Firstly, maldigesters consume less dairy foods, and secondly, excess lactose is digested by colonic microflora. Lactose intolerance in maldigesters may occur with random lactose ingestion. However, lactose intolerance without maldigestion tends to detract from gaining a clear understanding of the mechanisms of symptoms formation and leads to confusion with regards to dairy food consumption. The main consequence of intolerance is withholding dairy foods. However, regular dairy food consumption by lactase non persistent people could lead to colonic adaptation by the microbiome. This process may mimic a prebiotic effect and allows lactase non persistent people to consume more dairy foods enhancing a favorable microbiome. This process then could lead to alterations in outcome of diseases in response to dairy foods in lactose maldigesters. The evidence that lactose is a selective human prebiotic is reviewed and current links between dairy foods and some diseases are discussed within this context. Colonic adaptation has not been adequately studied, especially with modern microbiological techniques.

ICHNEUMONIDAE: : Xanthocryptus Cameron 1901
intricate past has many secrets but as the story unfolds, we learn a bit more of him and his background... as a "vampire hunter".To some, what i've already written and will write may appear to be spoilers but on the contrary, it is merely a template for which i can elaborate further on this highly entertaining and intriguing story... after all, the journey of these two has only just begun.I do acknoledge that the concept of vampires has been used numerous times and you would probably anticipate a myriad of action scenes followed by blood thirsty vampires roaming the city but you would only be half correct. This manga diverges quite a bit from this "expected" storyline by making the relationship between misaki and kuroe a main part of this chronicle.As you continue to read this manga,you would probably be reminded a lot of the anime called Kure-nai (for those who have seen it) in which a young girl has feelings for her guardian who is significantly older. Kuroe so far only thinks of Misaki as a child and wants to protect her from the dangers of vampires with malicious intent.Another enjoyable part of this story is that as a viewer you would "sometimes" get to see the thoughts of Misaki and her feelings for Kuroe, which are further implied through her actions. I personally find this really enjoyable as her character is like a tsundere... acting independant and throwing tantrums yet deep inside she wants someone to depend on and someone who cares for her.Besides the romance, there are quite a few action scenarios, which are intense, clearly portrayed and very easy to follow. The art is detailed and aesthethically pleasing. The panels are nicely separated but at times also merges different panels together without borders thus creating something new (to me) and creative. This innovative style gives you as the reader, an enjoyable feel as you're eyes follows the flow of the story through those merged panels.One small thing i did notice over time is that when Kuroe is dressed for a mission, he looks exactly, if not almost like a splitting image of Hei from Darker than BLACK (a bit down the story), which just adds as a bonus for me because i admire Hei as a character.Overall Blood Alone proves to be a truly remarkable manga, which ingeniously surpasses other mangas of its genre, one notably being "Vampire Knight" (yes, you heard that statement correctly) and it exhibits a realistic feel of romance, while providing a great fantasy storyline for us readers to enjoy.N.B. The main story is yet to be revealed therefore this review may change as the story develops and also i hope that you enjoyed my thoughts of this manga.

It's always tempting to grade Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency on a curve. Should it be judged on its own, or as an adaptation? The show does not seem to be designed to appeal to fans of the Douglas Adams series, in that it resembles that series in no way at all beyond the name of its titular detective. Gone is the uniquely British sensibility of the book, the shabby, pessimistic vibe of Dirk's whole persona, the wry humor of Adams' writing. In its place is a show that's been fed through some of the worst impulses in American filmmaking.

Toronto, Ontario, September 3, 2017 —A new Ipsos poll for Global News has found that more than half (54%) of Canadian parents agree (15% strongly/39% somewhat) that the cost of their kids' activities puts a strain on their family's finances. Indeed, the strain is enough to put some families in the red: more than one in four (27%) agree (5% strongly/21% somewhat) they've gone into debt to finance their children's activities.

Last week, fraternities near the University of Texas at Austin were vandalized with messages spray painted on or near their houses. The first fraternity to be targeted was Phi Gamma Delta, also known as Fiji. On Monday, the words "rapist" and "racist" appeared on the pillars near their gates. Throughout the week, other fraternities, including Kappa Alpha, Kappa Sigma, and Pi Kappa Alpha were also targeted. The university's student newspaper, the Daily Texan, reports that the graffiti ranged from accusations of racism and rape to threats such as "kill frat boys" and "nuke the frats."

Bowerman had wanted to be a doctor, but couldn't afford to pay for medical school. Instead, he started his career as a running coach; first at Portland's Franklin High School, then at his alma mater, Medford High School. After a tour of duty in Italy during World War II, Bowerman returned a hero and was recruited to replace Hayward at the University of Oregon upon the elder coach's retirement.Bowerman pioneered a training method now used by the majority of running coaches: instead of pushing athletes day after day, Bowerman allowed for "easy" and "hard" workout days and focused on each person's specific needs and goals. Author Kenny Moore adds in his book " Bowerman and the Men of Oregon " that Bowerman's approach was like that of a "physical scientist," and that he constantly evolved his strategies.Through this method, which also pioneered the use of film to analyze performance, Bowerman "developed and guided 24 NCAA individual champions, won four national team titles and coached the U.S. track and field team in the 1972 Olympic Games ," according to his biography at the National Distance Running Hall of Fame, to which Bowerman was inducted in 2002.Bowerman wanted to create lighter apparel and shoes for his runners, and went to a local shoemaker for guidance. Bowerman created the first lightweight outsole shoe from some latex, leather, glue and his wife's waffle iron, and Nike, first known as Blue Ribbon Sports, was born . It was a joint venture between Bowerman and the Oregon half-miler Phil Knight, who tested some of Bowerman's earliest pairs, and remains the chairman and CEO of Nike today.Bowerman's innovations indelibly altered the future of running shoes . "From 1917, when Keds, the first popularly marketed sneaker, was introduced, until the 1960's, sports footwear underwent little change," The New York Times obituary of Bowerman notes.In addition, Bowerman's book "Jogging," published in 1967, helped spur a running boom in the U.S.

(CNN) — In 1908, a German prospector found a diamond in the Namibian Desert. The area came to be known as the Sperrgebiet, or "forbidden territory," and was soon overrun by Germans on the hunt for the precious stone (they annexed 10,000 square miles of the desert for themselves). Today, DeBeers and the Namibian government still run a joint operation in the area.

"Mission is handicapped without a sound biblical theology of mission and an understanding of the history of mission leading up to our current context. Constants in Context offers both of these elements. It is mission theology in historical perspective and/or a history of mission that is grounded theologically. The authors describe it as a systematic theology with mission at its core, and a church history shaped by the constant but always contextual Christian traditions. Furthermore it is a constructive contribution to how mission theology needs to be practical and lived out through today's church and in our world. Written collaboratively by Roman Catholic writers Stephen Bevans and Roger Schroeder, both Missionaries of the Divine Word (SVDs). It is a particularly insightful in regard to the history and the various streams of Catholic mission but it also addresses and learns from the other traditions of the church. In fact, one of the book's strengths is its attention to neglected aspects and hidden stories of church and mission history. As a result it is gratifying to be inspired by non-European mission, women in mission and various forgotten or often ignored branches of the church. The book is in three sections: first, there is a framework for cultural contexts and theological constants; second, an in-depth exploration of historical stages and different models for mission; and third, a presentation of theological frameworks for mission. The third section concludes with a case for 'mission as prophetic dialogue' being the most appropriate model for 21st century mission." -- Amazon.com.
Mihajlovic: 'I found my Milan'
For those that did not see the clip that we posted a link to yesterday, Angle has filmed a reality show called "The Real Angle". A teaser of the show is posted HERE. In the clip, he admits to cheating with a woman years ago who ended up being arrested for stalking the Angles. The woman he was referring to was Deann Siden, reports ProWrestling.net. She was arrested in May of 2003 for stalking the couple and is also believed to have stalked Ric Flair as well. Apparently, Siden left numerous phone messages stating that she was having Kurt's baby and also threatened Karen during that time period. At the time of the incident, Angle denied the affair. You can read the article on the woman's arrest HERE. For what it's worth, the clip of the reality show is definitely worth checking out. It's not a short clip and is almost an actual episode in itself that really depicts the life of the Angles behind the scenes. In the footage, Angle talks about a "tell all" book he wants to write, training for an MMA fight with Randy Couture, trying to be a better father, and he also has some very choice words for Mr. McMahon.

A GUERNSEY believed to be the oldest in VFL/AFL history will be on display at St Kilda's coming 140th anniversary celebrations.The Saints have unearthed a club jumper that was worn by James Burt Stewart in his one year with St Kilda in 1888.The canvas lace-up guernsey had been kept by Stewart's descendants at their home in Ararat.The exact date of the jumper can be verified by multiple clues – research shows that Stewart spent only the one season with the Saints after the team merged with Prahran at the end of 1887 and accompanying the jumper was a Prahran member's ticket from 1887 that shows he vice-captained the club that year.St Kilda historian Russell Holmesby said there were no jumpers still in existence that were older than Stewart's."The National Sports Museum have some jumpers that go back to the 1890s but this is older than all of them," he said."Some clubs, like Collingwood didn't even exist then, so we've got a tangible piece of our history that is older than the entire Collingwood Football Club."James Stewart's jumper will be on display at St Kilda's 140th birthday celebrations and Hall of Fame presentation on May 4.Tickets are on sale for the event here: https://oss.ticketmaster.com/aps/stkilda/EN/buy/details/FUNC504

Crohn's disease (CD) is a complex disorder resulting from the interaction of intestinal microbiota with the host immune system in genetically susceptible individuals. The largest meta-analysis of genome-wide association to date identified 71 CD–susceptibility loci in individuals of European ancestry. An important epidemiological feature of CD is that it is 2–4 times more prevalent among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) descent compared to non-Jewish Europeans (NJ). To explore genetic variation associated with CD in AJs, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) by combining raw genotype data across 10 AJ cohorts consisting of 907 cases and 2,345 controls in the discovery stage, followed up by a replication study in 971 cases and 2,124 controls. We confirmed genome-wide significant associations of 9 known CD loci in AJs and replicated 3 additional loci with strong signal (p<5×10 −6 ). Novel signals detected among AJs were mapped to chromosomes 5q21.1 (rs7705924, combined p = 2×10 −8 ; combined odds ratio OR = 1.48), 2p15 (rs6545946, p = 7×10 −9 ; OR = 1.16), 8q21.11 (rs12677663, p = 2×10 −8 ; OR = 1.15), 10q26.3 (rs10734105, p = 3×10 −8 ; OR = 1.27), and 11q12.1 (rs11229030, p = 8×10 −9 ; OR = 1.15), implicating biologically plausible candidate genes, including RPL7, CPAMD8, PRG2, and PRG3. In all, the 16 replicated and newly discovered loci, in addition to the three coding NOD2 variants, accounted for 11.2% of the total genetic variance for CD risk in the AJ population. This study demonstrates the complementary value of genetic studies in the Ashkenazim.

We would say that the "vestige" is more apostrophe-shaped, with extra business also visible at the midpoint of the final 2--apparently the lower curve of the first 2.

But some militaries dream bigger than others. From winged tanks and DiY armored cars, to tanks studded with flamethrowers, here are some of the most bizarre examples of experimental tanks. Not surprisingly, most of these never saw much action in the field.

I'd like to share a memorable and unique thunder experience I had roughly 30 years ago. I was lying down and just barely drifting into sleep in an attic with large windows about a block away from the Atlantic Ocean on the Jersey shore. It was a summer night, late, no storm activity that I was aware of, either before or after.I was lying there with my eyes closed, not quite asleep, when there was an absolutely blinding flash that came right through my closed eyelids and simultaneously (as far as I could tell) an IMMENSE crack of thunder ... which then, over a period of five to ten seconds "rolled" off into the distance with slight, seemingly wave form, undulations.I was up and on my feet within a second or so of the flash, listening to the receding thunder and trying to put together in my head what just happened. I imagine that a significant bolt of lightning must have come "out of nowhere" (so to speak) and hit a lightning rod on top of one of the cupolas of the house and that I was then listening to echoes of the thunder bouncing back to me as the sound wave moved outward. My adrenaline level was so high it took me over an hour to calm down and get back to sleep (after wandering around looking out all the windows for either evidence of damage or other storm activity.) I was so spooked I was wondering for a bit if I'd gotten hit and was actually dead! LOL!Heh... glad I hadn't picked that night to sit out on the roof and do any stargazing!MJM

NEW DELHI: India's first nuclear armed submarine is now ready for full fledged operations, having passed several deep sea diving drills as well as weapons launch tests over the past five months and a formal induction into the naval fleet is only a political call away.Multiple officials closely associated with the project to operationalize the INS Arihant nuclear missile submarine have confirmed to ET that the indigenously-built boat is now fully-operational and over the past few months, several weapon tests have taken place in secrecy that have proven the capabilities of the vessel.The Arihant, which is the first of five nuclear missile submarines or SSBNs planned for induction, has also undergone deep sea dives off Vishakhapatnam where it was build. A Russian diving support ship —the RFS Epron that arrived on October 1 — has been accompanying the Arihant on its deep sea dives and launch tests, officials told ET.The Epron — a Prut class submarine rescue vessel — was also the Russian representation for the recently concluded International Fleet Review (IFR) in Vishakhapatnam. India does not currently possess a submarine rescue vessel of this class – a vital requirement during weapon firing tests where all possibilities need to be catered for. The Arihant incidentally did nottake part in the IFR even though it was ready due to security concerns. The presence of 24 foreign warships, equipped with sensors and equipment that could pick up vital electronic intelligence being the main deterrent.The Navy has managed to keep under wraps several weapon launch tests from the Arihant over the past five months. The submarine is to be equipped with K 15 (or BO-5) shortrange missiles with a range of over 700 km and the K 4 ballistic missile with a range of 3,500 km. "It has passed all tests and in many things has surpassed our expectations.Technically the submarine can now be commissioned at any time," a senior official said. Sources told ETthat the commissioning date could be as early as next month if the Modi government desires. A communication facility to interact with the submarine has already been commissioned into the Navy.At present, work is already in progress on two more Arihant class submarines at the Ship Building Center (SBC) in Vishakhapatnam which will be larger and more advanced than the first boat. The navy is also accelerating work on INS Varsha – a new strategic naval base with underground pens on the Eastern Coast near Kakinada – where the nuclear assets would be based.The Navy's Submarine Design Bureau is also presently working on a new class of nuclear powered attack submarines (SSNs) that it hopes to induct within the next 15 years. The plan is to build at least six SSNs in India, with financial sanction given last year for the project that could cost upwards of Rs 90,000 crore. At present, the only nuclear powered platform in service is the INS Chakra, a Akula class SSN on lease from Russia.

I make it a point to keep up with the latest sex and relationships news but, unfortunately, I find that a lot of the media reports on these topics are not very well written and tend to be overly sensationalized. Part of the problem is that many of the people we trust to report on science don't have a solid understanding of statistics and the scientific method. As a result, I constantly come across articles that are misleading or, in some cases, completely false. What I'd like to do in this article is share some of most sensationalized articles I've come across in recent years and explain where the reporting went wrong.

Following the tragic death of their five-year-old son Frankie, Irish couple Johnny and Sarah Sullivan and their remaining two offspring, 10 year old Christy Sullivan and 5 year old Ariel Sullivan, emigrate illegally to the United States via Canada with little in their pockets.

They move into a unit in a run town tenement housed primarily with drug addicts, transvestites and one tenant coined "the man who screams". They do whatever they can to eke out a supportive family environment in this difficult situation, the support which ultimately extends to those around them, most specifically "the screamer" who turns out to be an African-American artist named Mateo with AIDS.

Hi there My search started at the following page, with some interesting facts and figures: http://www.photodude.com/weblog/dumped/2002/November/002380.shtml From here, there's a link to the following page with more interesting stats: http://www.cnn.com/2002/EDUCATION/11/20/geography.quiz/index.html Rather worryingly, 11% of US citizens aged 18-24 couldn't locate the United States on a map! To view the questions go here: http://www.nationalgeographic.com/geosurvey/download/RoperSurvey.pdf Relevant questions are No.'s 18 -23 (p 54-57). Unfortunately, the maps used for the questions are not included. Within the report findings of note are: 'Younger Americans are less likely that older Americans to know where Israel (21% vs 29%) and Afghanistan (17% vs 23%) are on a world map.' 'The proportion of young Americans deeming map reading "absolutely necessary" decreased significantly from 1988 (from 74% to 43% among 18-24 year olds).' There's a host of other facts and figures in the report which you may find useful. There are several references and comparisons, with figures included, for the 1988 survey (conducted by Gallup) but I can't find the '88 survey as a separate entity on the net. A useful source could be: Gallup Poll (1988). "Geography: An International Gallup Survey." Princeton, NJ: The Gallup Organization You might be able to find it in your library. It's not only Americans that are poor when it comes to geography: 'Young Americans fared worse than their peers in seven of the eight other countries surveyed earlier this year, though no national group earned an excellent mark. Young people in the other English-speaking countries in the study—Canada and Great Britain—scored almost as poorly as Americans on a test of geography and current events.' http://www.edweek.org/ew/ewstory.cfm?slug=13geography.h22 Again, a comparison of results across countries can be read in the National Geographic report. This page gives some figures regarding estimates of population size for 1971: http://www.cals.cornell.edu/dept/ruralsoc/extension/nys/stycos/jmax.txt The full survey does not appear to be online however. This site gives some stats comparing Americans with Canadians: http://www.recorder.ca/cp/national/021201/n120108A.html I've searched extensively for other, earlier surveys. There doesn't appear to be any online sources. I suggest finding the Gallup reference in the library to locate other pre 1988 sources. If you require clarification of this answer, please don't hesitate.

The Bering Strait is a waterway that separates Russia from North America. It lies above the Bering Land Bridge (BLB), also called Beringia (sometimes misspelled Beringea), a submerged landmass that once connected the Siberian mainland with North America. While Beringia's shape and size while above water is variously described in publications, most scholars would agree the land mass included the Seward Peninsula, as well as existing land areas of northeast Siberia and western Alaska, between the Verkhoyansk Range in Siberia and the Mackenzie River in Alaska. As a waterway, the Bering Strait connects the Pacific Ocean to the Arctic Ocean over the polar ice cap, and eventually the Atlantic Ocean.

Raijintek is full of cool ideas this year, but the best yet has to be their pumpless water cooler. The 240mm equipped radiator and block runs completely silent and has no moving parts. It uses evaporation to pull the liquid into the radiator, where it cools, then flows back into the block. What's really crazy is that the harder you run your system, the more heat you put into it, the better it works and Raijintek tell us it can handle some pretty hefty workloads and deliver great cooling.

MAP, or mean arterial pressure, is defined as the average pressure in a patient's arteries during one cardiac cycle. It is considered a better indicator of perfusion to vital organs than systolic blood pressure (SBP). True MAP can only be determined by invasive monitoring and complex calculations; however it can also be calculated using a formula of the SBP and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

Considering how much we have all aged since the spring, it's understandable if you don't immediately recall that Mandy Moore survive-the-sharks movie 47 Meters Down. But like The Shallows before it, the deep-sea thriller that is entirely about not getting eaten by sharks wildly overperformed its projected box-office take, making more than $50 million around the world on a budget of about $5 million. With that kind of return, it was only a matter of time until the property got a sequel, and now The Hollywood Reporter is saying just that. Writer and director Johannes Roberts will return for, wait for it … 48 Meters Down, which will do some version of the exact same thing, except in waters off the coast of Brazil instead of Mexico. While the first movie revolved around a pair of sisters on a bonding trip, 48 Meters Down will feature a group of girls who want to avoid tourist traps, choosing instead to set out for a more authentic adventure experience.

In an upcoming book, former BJP social media cell volunteer Sadhvi Khosla reveals how they were asked to target minorities, Aamir Khan and journalists.On October 2 last year, Sadhvi Khosla, then a volunteer with the BJP's social media unit, stared at the reflection on her cell phone screen, and wondered about the person she had become. Her grandfather was a freedom fighter, while she had simply degenerated into a troll. As various BJP-run Whatsapp groups she had subscribed to spewed hatred at Mahatma Gandhi, Khosla claims she started introspecting. "I felt guilty. I asked myself what I had got myself into. Gandhi is a hero I have grown up with. It is not the BJP's stated position to abuse him, but that is how the ideology works," Khosla, who is holidaying abroad, told Mirror over phone yesterday.Khosla's story forms a major part of a recently released book by journalist Swati Chaturvedi. 'I am a Troll', published by Juggernaut, reveals the dark side of BJP's social media unit, which, Khosla describes in the book, as a "never-ending drip feed of hate and bigotry."Chaturvedi, herself a victim of right-wing trolls, writes in her book, "Who are these trolls with their false names and fake photographs? Where do they come from? Why do they do what they do? Do they act as an organised whole or work spontaneously? Are they just fans of the BJP and Prime Minister Modi or is there a more formal link with the party?One of the many startling revelations Chaturvedi in her book makes is about how the BJP social media cell carried on a concerted campaign against actor Aamir Khan after he remarked about "India's growing tolerance" in November last year, and ensured that he was dropped by shopping website SnapDeal as its brand ambassador.Khosla, who currently heads a knowledge processing company in Gurgaon, told Mirror that she was in the US in 2013, when she got a call from then Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi to join the party's social media cell. "I had taken a sabbatical for 6 months but it got extended. We worked for 18-hours a day tweeting and organising Chai Par Charcha," she said. Khosla added that she was drawn to the BJP because of its agenda of change. "The UPA government was getting arrogant. Like the rest I, too, had my reasons, I was looking for a change for better.. better jobs, better economy," she said. She said "change" was being advocated by many, including Anna Hazare, but she chose Modi.She says in the book that her enthusiasm dimmed when she was asked, along with other members of the social media cell, to target minorities and journalists, among others. (In a post on Juggernaut's blog, Chaturvedi writes: "…I was shaken when I discovered the secret "IT shakhas" and the depth of the rigorous planning of social media operations…I was also taken aback by the sheer ordinariness of the trolls. Here were people abusing, slandering and indulging in communal incitement, making rape and death threats, yet treating it like a 9-to-5 call centre job.")Then, Khosla found the man – Arvind Gupta heads the BJP's social media unit -- she worked for 18 hours a day turn a deaf ear to her tweets seeking support for war on drugs in Punjab. "BJP is part of the government there, I must have sent 5,000 tweets on Punjab and on the Akalis' involvement in drug rackets. There was silence," she said.Even as her candid confessions to Chaturvedi make headlines, Khosla is reticent about revealing too many details. She refused to talk about her colleagues in the social media cell, or who she used to report to. She is equally wary of implicating the party. "Let's stick to facts, it is not that BJP social media cell did anything to those who did not follow instructions. Like the Aamir Khan campaign, it was up to me whether to follow the instructions or not," she said.Khosla also said just because she grew disenchanted with the BJP doesn't mean that her compatriots' fervour, too, had dimmed."To each his own. I felt guilty of being part of the hate campaign, because I realised that unity of our nation is more necessary than a bullet train," she said.She also said that the book merely builds on what has been in the public domain for long."It is wrong to say that I approached someone to vent my disillusionment. I had even tweeted the grab of Arvind Gupta's Whatsapp message to me on the 'Aamir Khan campaign'," she said.She added that she will support Modi whenever he takes a decision in national interest. "I support demonetisation

This was made for a friend of mine who is awfully worried about coming out. Show your pride honey!But as usual there has to be a hidden joke and a bit of info in my SatW drawings. I read an article in a magazine about a study some students had made to find out what countries were the most gay friendly, not only legally (LGBT rights) but also the general public opinions about LGBT people, number of hate crimes, and such things. The top three were Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark on a third place despite not allowing homosexual church weddings, hens Sweden's "He won't marry you" line.One part of the explanation was, "If you as a LGBT person wants to go on a vacation were you can show public affection for your partner and won't have to answer questions when asking for one bed at the hotels, yet still wants to go sightseeing, these are the countries to go to"The second picture is my answer to a question I got about whatever or not Niels, Duncan and Natalie had ever been to a gay pride parade. The answer being no, because Duncan would freak out if he saw a man with wings and pink fur undies within three meters of him and punch the first guy he met with a green wig on. What can I say? He's okay with being bi, he just isn't into the more flamboyant part of the community.The gold thong on a truck is an inside joke, but I'm sure you guys will get it anyway if you've ever been to a pride parade or seen pictures. ;)EDIT: Yes, they have legs. And yes, that is two female symbols on Natalie's shirt. Just think of it as her supporting Billy too as one of the "boys". ;p

BRUSSELS—European scientists are celebrating a windfall in funding for the European Union's flagship research program, Horizon 2020, which is set to receive almost €70 billion over the next 7 years, an increase of nearly 30% over its predecessor, Framework Programme 7.

Her remarks have been edited for brevity and clarity.
To stop a rooster from crowing, make a collar out of double-sided Velcro to restrict the flow of air to its voice box and reduce the volume of its crowing. To put on the collar, place the rooster on your lap with its head facing away from you. Then, push up the feathers around its neck, wrap the collar around it, and secure the Velcro. Afterwards, check that the collar isn't too tight by sliding your pinky between the collar and the rooster's neck.

The rule-making body of the Democratic National Committee on Saturday defeated an amendment brought by Bernie Sanders delegates to abolish superdelegates — the unelected party elites who make up 15 percent of all delegates and are allowed to cast a vote for the presidential candidate of their choice, unbound by the popular vote. But the rules committee did approve a compromise measure that binds some superdelegates to the results of their state primaries.

EXTRA-PAIR copulations (EPCs) seem to be one of the most widespread alternative reproductive behaviours by which male birds can increase their fitness1,2. In many species females actively solicit or freely engage in EPCs3–5, which suggests that they benefit from them. Of the eight hypothetical benefits proposed2,6, the most likely are genetic2. Often females engage in EPCs with more dominant males3,7 or with males with more elaborate ornaments8,9. In species in which paternity was assigned, extra-pair young were divided asymmetrically between males10–12. Here, combining detailed behavioural work with DNA-fingerprinting of an entire population, we present evidence that such an asymmetry is indeed caused by female behaviour, and that 'attractive' males do not suffer lost paternity, survive better and recruit more young. Our results support the genetic quality hypothesis.
Hugo woke up with the sun that day as the first signs of morning began to peek over the hills, drenching his small cottage in a deep amber hue. The light reflected off the early morning dew like tiny, twinkling eyes. They looked like they were laughing at the sun as it crept higher into the sky. The anticipation for that day's events had led to a largely sleepless night for Hugo and now, as eager as he was, he could barely coerce his body to keep pace with his mind's enthusiasm. Hugo shook the remnants of last night's dreams from his head as he begrudgingly forced himself to get up. He made his bed meticulously, smoothing down the edges of his quilt until it lay flat against the mattress like saran wrap. He fluffed his pillows and straightened the edges of their plain white pillowcases, once, twice, three times. The faint smell of his lavender laundry detergent wafted through the air as he shuffled his bedding around, sprouting delicate flowers from the sheets and spilling soil onto the bedroom floor. He tilted his head to the side, making sure everything was even and in place. Everything had to be perfect today.

The previous BMA chairman, among others, is on record as saying that Harold Shipman is unique, yet medicine has arguably thrown up more serial killers than all the other professions put together, with nursing a close second.1–4 Dentistry too has had its notorious characters, yet among veterinarians homicide seems to be almost unknown. "Jack the Ripper," the perpetrator of five unsolved murders in 1888 in London, is thought to have been a member of the medical profession, although there is no conclusive evidence. Sir William Gull, "physician in ordinary" to Queen Victoria, and Dr Thomas Barnardo were prime suspects, and there were advocates for Montague John Druitt, a barrister (he was from a respected medical family and may have passed himself off as a doctor); a Dr Stanley (he may have been fictitious); the Polish Dr George Chapman (real name Severin Klosowski); and the Russian Dr Alexander Pedachenko.5–7 Nor has conclusive evidence been found for Gaylord Sundheim (a psychotic who had studied medicine) being the "mad butcher" of Cleveland, Ohio, in the 1930s.8 Summary points Arguably medicine has thrown up more serial killers than all the other professions put together

This is a book that I bought over a month ago and had been meaning to read ASAP. Finally, I had a gap in my schedule and sat down with the paperback. I've never considered myself all that much of a fan of horror, probably because I assume that means there will be overdone violence/gore for the sake of shock value, stupid characters making stupid choices that leave them meat for a killer, or child death (I tend to avoid books/movies with that as there's quite enough of that in the news.) While there are allusions to murdered children in this book, it's off-camera and you don't 'get to know' any of the victims per se prior to that, which while unsettling isn't past my limit. There was only enough of it to underscore the type of creatures the witches are in this setting. Anyway, here is my Review:

Diabetes Type 3—which is regarded as "brain" specific diabetes—is a dangerous diabetes hybrid that was first discovered in 2005. A study, which was conducted at Brown University Medical School, suggests the brain produces insulin in a way that's similar to the pancreas. A problem with insulin production in the brain is thought to result in the formation of protein "plaque"—not unlike that which is found among suffers of Type 1 (insulin-dependant) and Type 2 diabetes (insulin-resistant). But in the case of diabetes Type 3, plaque appears in the brain and leads to memory loss and problems forming memories.

Steeling, and stropping for that matter, are very simplistic procedures, very useful and helpful, but very misunderstood and when performed incorrectly become very destructive for the edge. Steeling being the more misunderstood and abused of those two. Although, those two processes do serve the same purpose, both very often are mistaken for sharpening, which is a completely different process. What's strange and bad, you see a lot of wanna be experts, seasoned cooks, including celebrity chefs, and I don't know who else, rubbing their knives vigorously against the grooved butcher's steel telling you how this sharpens a knife. That is plain wrong and grooved steel is a crime against the edge anyway :)

More specifically, the idea of semolina in places you wouldn't normally find it (i.e. outside the homemade pasta world). Luckily, this recipe was almost accidentally vegan!

It's worth remembering that, 13 years into Barkley's own career, Barkley threw a 5-foot-nothing guy through a plate glass window at 2 a.m. Perhaps Howard should have brought this up.

Last bit for now: I went over every single open issue in the engine repo on GitHub to see which might matter for v1.0.0, and v2.0.0 for that matter. Closed a pile of stuff too. Sorry for the notification spam!v1.0.0 has a full 51 issues in it now, but that's with a lot of probably-already-done or super simple things that just need a quick bit of work or confirmation that indeed it is no longer an issue. Then lots of niceties we could work on before releasing v1.0.0 - I'm thinking we could aim for December 1st. I know a lot won't be done by then and that's fine, but this way we have a nice grouping of mostly usability issues to hitI also looked for things thatcause changes to the modding API by fixing some quirky behavior witnessed in the past, marking those as " blockers " since they could be either fix now or in v2.0.0 (or fix with backwards compatibility in mind when it happens). Again chances are that some/most of those are invalid or non-issues for v1.0.0v2.0.0 mainly has the entity system overhaul but I kept an eye out for event-related issues that might be affected by it or good to look at while in there anyway. Couple other big fish for the future in there too just because they almost certainly won't be in v1.0.0 and would need a major release.There is one giant doc issue now as well with 20ish sub-items that'll likely grow. We should really hit documentation hard as part of v1.0.0. More details later. @minnesotags also updated his server to the latest dev build as of this writing + reset the world for more testing. Good stuff and it has more minerals now tooIt may have been small and quiet but I still consider this "birthday op success"I'll try to release v0.54.3 sometime tomorrow or Tuesday then I'm flying to NYC Wednesday for a family visit + a charity event to meet Bill Nye (nerdy woo!).

We were talking on the podcast this week about how Trion Worlds tends to aggressively pursue different revenue streams in its MMOs — and how those actions sometimes cross the line and land the studio in hot water with the playerbase. For example, RIFT's pay-to-win shortcut a week or so ago.

First and foremost: I, the author of this piece, don't actually care whether or not Mike Pence speaks at Notre Dame. That's an institutional decision above my paygrade, and banning him would be a merely ideological exercise. My point here is discursive. Ideology and Catholicism have a long history in this country, if not the world over. Examining how faith relates to socio- political shibboleths seems enjoined upon us in 2017. Please do keep all that in mind as you read.

Last August, we discussed the launch of a new type of NAND memory design that eschewed PCIe slots or SATA interfaces in favor of attaching flash directly to the DIMM channel. Developed by Diablo Technologies, this new approach promised incredibly low latencies and consistent performance that conventional PCIe architectures have difficulty matching. Now, SanDisk has taken an interest Diablo Technologies and has partnered with the company to release a shipping product.

KUDANKULAM: Stepping up their protest against the atomic power plant here, anti-nuclear activists today stood in sea waters forming a human chain off nearby Indinthakarai coast.Taking a leaf from 'Jal Satyagraha' activists in Madhya Pradesh, the activists of People's Movement Against Nuclear Energy (PMANE) stood in the waters close to the shores in a new turn to their year-long protests.Police, whose presence has been strengthened in and around the sea shores with additional forces, have beefed up security along the coast to prevent any untoward incident during the day-long protest.The agitators have put forward four demands - stoppage of the process of fuel loading in Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project, drop the plan to arrest anti-nuclear movement leaders, adequate compensation for those who suffered losses and release of those already taken into custody.The new form of protest came even the whereabouts of PMANE leader S P Udayakumar remained unknown after he did somersault on his offer to surrender before police after the protest turned violent that led to police firing claiming the life of one fisherman in Tuticorin district on Monday.The current bout of intensified protests, including the failed bid to lay siege to the plant, was launched by PMANE to prevent loading of fuel for which regulatory authorities gave the approval recently.On September 10, the Madhya Pradesh government had agreed to the main demands of protesters who undertook a 'Jal Satyagraha' in Khandwa district, saying they would be given land as compensation and height of Omkareshwar Dam would be reduced.The entire Kudankulam town had almost been sealed by police since yesterday with the personnel taking positions at strategic places, especially around the KNPP where the preparations for loading of enriched uranium are underway.Police said they conducted a house-to-house search for PMANE activists, wanted in connection with Monday's incidents, in the Tsunami village near here last night.

Antonio Sabato Jr. claims that he's been bullied endlessly in the days following his appearance at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Not only online, but by Hollywood directors who have blacklisted him. On July 18, the actor opened the RNC in Cleveland with a speech about why he's supporting Donald Trump, calling him the "unity" candidate, who would secure borders and protect citizens. Sabato Jr. reached out to Variety to share what he says happened next.

What sets this watch apart though is the steel bezel and steel riveted bracelet (the bracelet being optional, there is a version with a leather strap too). Much like the vintage pieces a lot of people crave (think the Tudor reference 7922 and 7924), this steel bracelet has a thinner construction with rivets. It's just like the good old days – you can read more about the history of these bracelets here. Furthermore, the steel bezel is totally awesome and something we haven't seen from Tudor since 1999, with the reference 79190. It gives the Black Bay a distinct tool watch feel and a certain ruggedness.

Things haven't gone as planned for the New Orleans Saints this season. They might very well still end up in the place they were planning to land — atop the NFC South — but nobody could have imagined they would take this path to get there. At 5-8, it has been a wildly disappointing campaign for one of the preseason Super Bowl favorites. That came to a head this week, when Sean Payton responded to the team's fourth consecutive loss at home, a 41-10 shellacking by Carolina, by releasing reserve wideout Joe Morgan and benching safety Kenny Vaccaro, the team's 2013 first-round pick.

2006 Code of Virginia § 18.2-308 - Personal protection; carrying concealed weapons; when lawful to carry
SHELOSHET YEMEI HAGBALAH (Heb. שְׁ ֶׁשת יְמֵי ַגְּבָּלָה; "the three days of limitation"), the name given to the three days immediately preceding the festival of Shavuot. The scriptural sources for distinguishing these days are found in Exodus 19:12, where God commands Moses, "And thou shalt set bounds unto the people," and Exodus 19:15, where Moses orders the children of Israel, "Be ready against the third day." (See also the discussion in Shabbat 87a as to how many days of "limitation" were ordered by God and how many by Moses.) The original limitations were against touching Mount Sinai (Ex. 19:12) and against having sexual intercourse (ibid. 19:15). The people were also commanded to sanctify themselves during these days (ibid. 19:10 and 14). According to the halakhah, marriage celebrations and haircuts, otherwise prohibited during most of the period between Passover and Shavuot, are permitted during these three days (Sh. Ar., OḤ 493:3 and Mishnah Berurah, ad loc.).

From the opening in the creek bed, Jacob's Well descends vertically for about thirty feet (ten meters), continuing from there at an angle as a series of chambers separated by narrow, often deeply silted and unstable necks, ultimately reaching a depth of at least one hundred and twenty feet (forty meters).

1. The man who invented one of the world's most well-known bulk trash containers—the Dempster Dumpster—once served as Knoxville's mayor. 2. It's home to the the Forensic Anthropology Center. The center contains a "body farm" where fresh human remains are placed in natural settings so budding forensic scientists can study their decomposition. 3. Actor and comedian Johnny Knoxville is actually from Knoxville, but his real name is Philip John "PJ" Clapp. 4. Proving it's a diverse and dichotomous place, Knoxville has been called "The Streaking Capital of the World" and "The Underwear Capital of the World." The former, coined by newsman Walter Cronkite, has to do with a mass streaking incident that occurred in the 1970s, the latter a reference to the undergarment textiles industry that was once huge in Knoxville. 5. In 1982, Knoxville was the smallest city to have ever hosted a World's Fair. 6. Cherry Coke, the branded prepackaged version of the longtime soda fountain favorite, was introduced at the Knoxville World's Fair. 7. The now-ubiquitous touch-screen was first demonstrated to the public at the 1982 World's Fair. Attendees might have laughed at the notion of carrying around such screens in their pockets one day. 8. It's against the law to lasso a fish in Knoxville. 9. Knoxville played a key role in the early success of Elvis Presley. An RCA talent scout heard a local record store blaring the future King's Sun Studios single "That's All Right" and brought it to the attention of the label, who ended up buying out Presley's contract from Sun Studios. 10. Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino was born in Knoxville. Browser not compatible. 11. The Oliver Hotel was originally built to house an ice cream saloon. 12. "Rocky Top" isn't the official fight song of the UT Volunteers. 13. And Volunteer is a nickname, not a mascot. 14. The UT Volunteers official mascot is a bluetick coonhound named Smokey. 15. The man who yelled the famous words "Damn the torpedoes! Full speed ahead!" during the Civil War Battle of Mobile Bay—Union Admiral David Farragut—was born in Knoxville in 1801. 16. It's where the soft drink Mountain Dew was invented in 1940. 17. Knoxvillians have their own name for Labor Day, Boomsday, named after the Boomsday celebration that features one of the country's largest and most impressive fireworks displays. It takes place over the Tennessee River and includes a waterfall of fireworks. 18. It's where Hank Williams, Sr. spent the last night of his life, at the Andrew Johnson Hotel. Now an office building, it was once the tallest structure in Knoxville. 19. According to an episode of "The Simpsons," the Sunsphere is filled with a surplus of unsold wigs. 20. In reality, the golden globe of the Sunsphere houses offices, an observation deck and event space. 21. Author Kurt Vonnegut, a counterculture literary hero of the 1960s and '70s, was an alumni of the University of Tennessee in Knoxville. 22. Nashville gets all the glory when it comes to country music, but it wouldn't exist without Knoxville providing the seedlings. It's known as "The Cradle of Country Music," the place where hillbilly music came out of the hills and found new footing. 23. Seminal country music legends Roy Acuff and Dolly Parton got their start in Knoxville. 24. The Everly Brothers also spent their formative years here. 25. Open-air Market Square was once dominated by a large building in its center called the Market House. 26. Market Square has served as a memorable setting in American literature. James Agee wrote about it in his Pulitzer Prize-winner novel "A Death in the Family," as did Cormac McCarthy in "The Orchard Keeper" and "Suttree." 27. City Hall used to sit at the north end of Market Square, approximately where the outdoor stage sits today. 28. The Knoxville Gazette was the first newspaper published in Tennessee. The first edition appeared in 1791. 29. WDVX, a popular local radio station that champions regional and Americana music, now calls the Knoxville Visitor Center home, but it began operation in a pull-trailer stationed in a campground off Interstate 75. 30. Knoxville is technically considered an international port. It's possible to travel by boat from downtown to the Gulf of Mexico and the Great Lakes. 31. Knoxville and Fort Knox in Kentucky are named after the same person, Henry Knox, the first Secretary of War for the U.S. 32. In addition to inventing the dumpster, George Dempster was the first steam shovel operator to begin moving earth to create the Panama Canal

I commute daily by autorickshaw from Nagarbhavi to Residency Road for work. I used to pay Rs 85. With the fare hike again, I may have to pay Rs 100. Is the extent of hike justified? It is distressing as it amounts to going by car or taxi. I will be paying Rs 50 extra every day, which means nearly Rs 1,500 for the month. How can the government go on increasing auto fares every one-and-a-half years? I will be forced to take a bus. The nightmare is there are auto fare hikes, but no change in attitude among the fraternity. If I can afford it, I'd rather take a taxi.The hike in auto fares is making citizens see red. The last fare was Rs 17 as minimum for 2km and Rs 9 per km; the new fare is Rs 20 as minimum for 1.8 km, and Rs 11 per km thereon - a steep hike by Rs 3 and Rs 2. While the auto ride now pinches, the experience of putting up with refusals is disturbing.Niharika K, a commuter, explains: "I travel from Banaswadi to MG Road and have to face the humiliation of refusals every day. You don't mind paying extra if drivers are nice to you. When I am treated badly, why should I spend my hard-earned money on them? I am tempted to give up and just take a taxi."Sandhya R, an HR professional , asks: "Has there ever been a change in the attitude of autorickshaw drivers? The hike comes often, but the attitude remains the same. The least we can get as compensation is polite and positive service.''Other citizens complain of the financial burden . "For me, it's an extra Rs 1,500 a month. Auto unions are threatening to hike fares again if LPG touches Rs 70. My salary doesn't go up every month, does it?" asks Nitin Raghu , a teacher.Ramya Raghavan, advertising professional, says: "The hike means an extra Rs 60 per day, and translates into Rs 2,000 a month. I may as well pay a little more and hire a taxi. There should be moderation in the hike, and good service."There are some auto drivers who agree that service has to improve. M Manjunath, president of Adarsha Auto Union , agrees with commuters' feelings. "I am aware that drivers refuse commuters. It's wrong. We are holding classes for our auto drivers telling them to stop refusing commuters, talk politely, and be sensitive and helpful."Manjunath agrees that some meters are tampered. "It is illegal and unethical. Our union has asked police to track such drivers and mechanics who tamper with meters and jail them. We want to deliver honest public service."But he disagrees with passengers on the fare hike issue. "I know the hike hurts. But people should also consider our plight: we work morning to night in the hot sun, drive around the city, pay high LPG and oil rates, insurance and maintenance cost. Besides, cost of living has gone up - ration , house rents, school fees. How can we make a comfortable living with just Rs 150 or Rs 200 per day? Even a labourer gets Rs 350 per day. We have to make Rs 600 or Rs 800 per day, pay the owner, pay for fuel and take home what remains. Sometimes, we make only Rs 500. The owner doesn't care whether we drivers make money or not, we have to pay him."The hike: Rs 17 to Rs 20 as minimum, from 2 km to 1.8 km, and Rs 9 per km to Rs 11 per kmSecond hike within 18 monthsPassengers humiliated by having to hail at least 10 to 12 times in CBD.Drivers fleece commuters for short-haul rides: demand Rs 30-40 for a 2km radius and Rs 50-70 for 3-4 km radius in CBDTraffic, lack of return passengers cited as reason for refusalAdarsha Auto Union agrees that honest and sensitive service is a mustEasy Autos are available, but very few people opt for call autos

Uber sees its ridesharing service as an ideal way to get you home safely when you're drunk, and it's trying out some relatively unique technology to prove its point. The company recently set up an Uber Safe kiosk in Toronto that gave sloshed Canadians a free ride if they blew into a breathalyzer -- much safer than stumbling on foot or struggling to hail a cab, if you ask us. The Toronto device was largely a promotional stunt, but Uber tells us that it's "thrilled" with the early response and to "stay tuned" for the possibility of more kiosks going forward. We can't imagine that Uber would continue to offer the Safe service free of charge if it catches on, but it's easy to see systems like this popping up in bar-heavy neighborhoods.

Macau, New Orleans, St. Louis, Pittsburgh, and San Francisco. All of these metropolitan centers were once frontier cities, urban areas irrevocably shaped by cross-cultural borderland beginnings. Spanning a wide range of periods and locations, and including stories of eighteenth-century Detroit, nineteenth-century Seattle, and twentieth-century Los Angeles, Frontier Cities recovers the history of these urban places and shows how, from the start, natives and newcomers alike shared streets, buildings, and interwoven lives. Not only do frontier cities embody the earliest matrix of the American urban experience; they also testify to the intersections of colonial, urban, western, and global history.
TL;DR – The biggest problem with Passengers is that it keeps hinting at a better film out there, but unfortunately it never quite gets there.
Bennett and Leibsohn blame the "marijuana lobby" for re-shaping the way Americans think about what they consider to be a truly dangerous drug. But the reality is that voters' views on pot have evolved in recent years based on both the failures of prohibition and the success of legalization and regulation. For decades, those opposed to amending cannabis criminalization warned that any significant change in marijuana policy would lead to a plethora of unintended consequences. Yet the initial experience in Colorado and Washington, in addition to many other states' deep-rooted experiences regulating the production and distribution of marijuana for therapeutic purposes, has shown these fears to be misplaced.
Mt. San Jacinto was one of the first big peaks I bagged as a teenager and I'm still drawn to it many years later. This route starts at the top of the Palm Springs Aerial Tram — a treat in itself — and although it's the "easiest" route it's by no means easy. This out-and-back trail travels 11 miles round trip with 3000 feet of vertical elevation climbed. At an elevation of 10,834 feet above sea level, Mt. San Jacinto offers amazing 360-degree views and an alpine environment that surprises first-time visitors.

For the first time, satellite broadcasters will be jockeying with other media outlets for a share of political spending that could top $3 billion this year. They've historically been shut out of the avalanche of campaign cash because their commercials were directed to a national audience, and didn't have the local reach of TV and radio stations.

SolarCity is going to reduce the manufacturing costs and the balance-of-system costs in the future. However, the competition cannot be written off. SolarCity will face stiff-competition from the large U.S. based solar corporations. SunPower, with its market leading panel-efficiency, and First Solar, with its lowering manufacturing costs and improving modular efficiency, are a threat to the future business prospects of SolarCity.

The chandelier of the Bone Church in Kutna Hora Macabre art at the Sedlec OssuaryThe Bone Church in Kutna Hora, also known as the Sedlec Ossuary from the district of the same name, is something that leaves you speechless: decorated with the bones of over 40 000 human skeletons, it leaves you mixed feelings: it's the guilt of artistically enjoying dead bodies, something that it's usually seen only as pain and suffering, without being scared or disgusted. But actually this crypt is a really an enjoyable and extraordinary piece of macabre art, and quite easy to reach on a day trip from Prague, only 70 km far away by car or train. We were not planning to go there, actually we didn't even know the existence of this place, until some friends during our nomad travel told us about it.

By now you can't have failed to miss the scandal engulfing Northumbia Police concerning their sexism against male victims of domestic violence. The police force, ultimately headed by radical feminist Police and Crime Commissioner Vera Baird produced a series of sexist and hopelessly outdated posters, all of which pushed the totally debunked narrative of domestic violence comprising of male perpetrators and female victims. To compound matters further, Baird refused to listen to anyone's concerns and instead blocked all manner of people who highlighted her sexism on Twitter, including male domestic violence victims in her own region who she was supposed to be helping.
To succeed in business or life, I came to realize that we must continually take remedial actions. Putting myself on the line day after day can be extremely draining, especially when things do not work out as I desired. Hence, each time I face a disappointing event or undesirable outcome, I NEVER FORGET these famous failures:
Most of us have wondered what we might do if we didn't need to work – if we woke up one morning to discover we had won the lottery, say. We entertain ourselves with visions of multiple homes, trips around the world or the players we would sign after buying Arsenal. For many of us, the most tantalising aspect of such visions is the freedom it would bring: to do what one wants, when one wants and how one wants.

Though Garcia is often remembered as Captain Trips, the avuncular psychedelic cheerleader, Mr. Bar-Lev locates in him something darker and lonelier. As he is portrayed in the early parts of the film, Garcia is a man of irrepressible, joyful charisma. It is painful to watch his inexorable decay as the enormity of the Grateful Dead enterprise pushes him toward the solace of heroin addiction and, ultimately, his death from a heart attack when he was 53.

Stars crowd together into galaxies, galaxies assemble into clusters, and clusters amass to form superclusters. Astronomers, probing ever-larger volumes of the cosmos, have been surprised again and again to find matter clustering on ever-larger scales. This Russian-nesting-doll-like distribution of matter has led them to wonder whether the universe is a fractal: a mathematical object that looks the same at any scale, whether you zoom in or out.
We think the Transcend DrivePro 200 is a great budget, heat resistant camera. It's a great value at $100 especially when combined with a 2-year warranty, 16GB card, Wi-Fi video playback and good customer service. The downside is the poor night video quality but is worth the trade off if you need the reliability. We're much less excited for the other cameras but they do have their uses.
The same financial alchemy has been performed at Polaroid and US Airways, at textile companies like Cone Mills and WestPoint Stevens, and at a host of smaller companies over the last four years. And bankruptcy specialists say that it is almost certain to keep happening, because shedding pensions -- and pensioners' health care obligations -- is turning into an irresistible way to make a high-risk investment pay off.

I'm happy that it gives me us all something great to listen to when we're stuck at our jobs instead of out living it up and seeing bands and drinking lemonade! Work sucks, but great tunes make it bearable. Thanks to all the bands, thank you for saving us from our mundane lives and giving us something to dance to!
Paris, 1967. Jean-Luc Godard, the maker of "A bout de souffle", "Le Mépris" and "Pierrot le fou", idolized by critics and intellectuals, is shifting from revolutionizing cinema to becoming a revolutionary tout court. Isn't he shooting "La Chinoise", more a political tract in favor of Maoism than an actual movie? His female star is Anne Wiazemsky, writer François Mauriac's granddaughter, sixteen years his junior. Anne and Jean-Luc have been dating since 1966 and they marry this very year. She admires Jean-Luc's originality, intelligence, wit and boldness while he loves Anne's freshness and - admiration of him. But May 1968 puts their marriage to the test. Godard, who is more and more involved in the revolution, indeed becomes less and less available to his young wife, which does not prevent him from acting jealous. It also looks as if the genius is losing his sense of humor. Written by Guy Bellinger

Clovis Maines is a simpleton living in back woods Georgia. He and his cohorts have been robbing gas stations, loan shops and tour buses. They have been able to pull these heists off with ease because Clovis is the nephew of the local sheriff and his two partners are police officers. The trouble begins when a random tour bus robbery is thwarted by the merc with a mouth himself... Deadpool. Deadpool throws the crooks out of the bus but he wants to talk to their third partner in the car (White Lightnin') so he can smite them. When first introduced to Clovis Deadpool can only laugh, until he is shown first hand why they call him White Lightnin'. After being struck by an electrical blast courtesy of White Lightnin' Deadpool wakes up some time later to find his fellow passengers trying to call the police. After someone finds a walky-talky Deadpool reveals that it was left by the police because they were the crooks who tried to rob them. Deadpool ventures to the Mason County sheriff office to find those who did him wrong and take a new mantle...sheriff. The female deputy tells Deadpool Clovis and his uncle, sheriff Dale, are at their still, once he is there he observes the two men. Dale spots a car, "an inner-loper" and has White Lightnin' destroy it. Clovis blasts the car, easily blowing it up, then starts to run back to the still but Deadpool snipes one his batteries ruining his "power suit." The battery acid covers him and starts burning his skin, blurring his vision and melting his clothes forcing him to strip down to his boxers. Shortly after this the men are surprised when they are suddenly surrounded by agents of the Georgia division of the A.T.F (department of alcohol, tobacco and firearms) who take them into custody. The A.T.F reveal that they were tipped off about their activities at the still by a female inside the operation. Clovis and Sheriff Dale claim they were set up by the "brains of the operation," the female insider, the female sheriff Darlene. She even tried setting Deadpool up with the two but it turns out before Deadpool set out on his "mission" he was suspicious of Darlene and had her call the A.T.F to stop their crime spree. Deadpool confirms the claims by taking them to their third accomplice from the bus robbery imprisoned at the sheriff's office. The A.T.F lets Deadpool go, surprisingly, and arrests the others including Clovis Maines the notorious White Lightnin'.
Some of climate change's most easy-to-spot impacts have, historically, been in the animal kingdom. Changing weather patterns have caused species ranges to shift, created a mismatch between migration arrival and the timing of bud bursts and insect hatching, and made it difficult for some species' babies to survive. Ocean acidification, another product of increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, has also created highly-visible impacts on the marine ecosystem, as has increased ocean temperatures.
If you're unfamiliar with Norman Plante we're about to change that.

You can also see him in at least a couple of our edits on YouTube, as well.
The Crank was a piece of machinery for punishment. It served no other purpose than to exhaust and punish a prisoner who had been misbehaving in Gaol, or was sentenced to Hard Labour. The prisoners would have to turn the handle up to 15,000 times a day. It was the job of the warders to set the crank - it could be made easier or harder, depending on how much the authorities wanted to punish the prisoner to be set to the crank. As this was done through screws on the crank itself, this was how the slang term for prison warders came about. The original "screws" were the - inevitably unpopular - warders who adjusted the settings of the crank.
"Now Secretary Clinton has said that Medicare for all will never happen.

"Medicare for all will never happen if we continue to elect corporate Democratic whores who are beholden to big pharma and the private insurance industry instead of us."
The Speicherstadt is the world's largest warehouse complex located in the port of Hamburg, within the HafenCity quarter. A city in itself, the district extends over 26 hectares and comprises of 17 building complexes, each seven to eight stories high, with more than 300,000 square meters of storage area. For over a hundred years, these warehouses have held high-value goods such as coffee, tea, cocoa, spices, tobacco, and, in recent decades, oriental carpets. Small outbuildings, which are connected by roads, waterways and bridges, functioned as offices. The building's Neo-Gothic red-brick outer facade features richly ornamented brickwork, alcoves, and glazed terra cotta ornaments that bear witness to the city's economic prosperity. Since 1991, the unique district has been given historic monument protection. Just recently, it was awarded the status of UNESCO World Heritage Site.

In a new article in Nature Climate Change scientists from NOAA's Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies show maps that illustrate how rising sea temperatures are likely to affect all coral reefs, including those in Polynesia, in the form of annual coral bleaching events under various different emission scenarios. Their results emphasize that without significant reductions in emissions most coral reefs on the planet are at risk for bleaching within the next several decades.

The above map shows all the locations in the Continental USA where at least a partial eclipse will be seen on Eclipse Day! That is to say, ALL locations! If you live along the path of totality, you can just stay home and see a total eclipse! (Clear skies permitting, that is!) Everyone else needs to travel to one of the twelve eclipse states to see this amazing spectacle. But traveling is simply not an option for everyone, due to commitments, finances, health, etc. But since everyone in the USA has a rare opportunity to see at least see a deep partial eclipse, everyone should make an effort to do so! So if you MUST stay home on Eclipse Day, this page will show you what to expect and how to prepare.
There have been scattered reports of several countries staging pre-World Cup camps in the United States. England had previously been planning friendlies in Boston and Washington, but after learning of their draw they may be aiming for a more humid stint and playing the US in South Florida: England are planning to tweak their pre-World Cup preparations to take into account the heat and humidity they expect to encounter in their opening match against Italy in Manaus. Plans to play one match in Washington or Boston while at a pre-tournament acclimatisation camp in the United States have been scrapped and the FA will now seek to play both warm-up games in Miami, to help prepare for the Amazon heat. One of the matches will be against the USA, with whom the FA has an agreement in principle, with the other opponent still to be decided. Presumably they'd play at Sun Life Stadium, home of the Miami Dolphins and various international friendlies in recent years. There's been a standing rumor about a friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina in St. Louis (do it, USSF! My sister should have an empty apartment for me to stay in!) although nothing further has been reported on that front. I would assume we'll see three friendlies again. Not sure whether there will be two here/one in Brazil (like last time) or three here. Generally speaking you might see broad similarities in style of upcoming group stage opponents. If not in March, I would hope the US plays at least one sub-Saharan African side ahead of the World Cup to try to get a feel for Ghana. 2002

If you watched the ESPN broadcast of the Sunday Night Baseball matchup between the Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox, you likely saw that the Tigers have already stolen more bases this year than they did all of last year. At 27-12 after the Sunday win, Detroit had the best record in baseball, and enjoyed a seven game lead in the AL Central. The Cool Standings page on FanGraphs gave them a 96.9 percent chance of making the playoffs and a 94.8 percent chance of winning the division, easily the best odds in baseball.

I've just returned from Paris where I spent the weekend with some former Guantánamo prisoners to mark the ninth anniversary since the opening of the Guantánamo Bay concentration camp – one of several such protest vigils, including outside the White House in Washington DC. One of the men in Paris, Sabir Lahmar, a Bosnian national of Algerian descent, was resettled in France last year after having spent eight years detained in Guantánamo without charge or trial.

HYDERABAD: Churning out thousands of successful candidates to get into Indian Institutes of Technology across the country, Hyderabad has outdone Kota in Rajasthan in coaching students build their foundation for the annual Joint Entrance Examination ( JEE ).Besides a large number of coaching centres springing up across the city, Hyderabad is the mecca for lakhs of students every year who come from various parts of the country to fulfil their dream of obtaining a seat in premier engineering and technological institutes.Started in 1987, the coaching industry in Hyderabad boomed in the early 2000s, wherein the number of students seeking coaching grew from a few thousands to a massive 20,000. "Before 1999, there were not many institutes offering IITJEE or Eamcet training. We realised the potential among students and started our junior colleges in 1999 in Dilsukh Nagar, Yousufguda and SR Nagar where we offered students an integrated curriculum for intermediate as well as IIT JEEE amcet," said Sushma Bopanna, academic director of Sri Chaitanya Educational Institutes.From 3,000 students training for JEE in the 90s to over 1.5 lakh this year, Hyderabad has dominated the merit list with almost 50 percent of the top 10 rankers for the past several years. If the results for JEE (advanced) 2016 are anything to go by, then six out of top 10 rankers were from Hyderabad.Although it has been a close race between the two cities, industry experts observe that Hyderabad has clearly dominated the merit list ever since 2006. "The fascination among students in Telangana and AP for JEE has only increased over the years. It is only in the last one decade that there has been a sudden rise in the number of takers. The coaching industry has only catered to the increasing demand," said Dheeraj Kumar Misra, regional director, operations, south zone at Aakash Educational Services Pvt Ltd While in 2006, as many as 938 candidates from Andhra Pradesh and 1,004 from Rajasthan made it to the IITs, in 2016, as many as 3,734 were from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, and 1,610 from Rajasthan.Officials from IIT-Madras, under which Hyderabad section falls, state that students from Hyderabad make up for over 20 percent of all those who make it to premier engineering institutes. This has been so for the past several years.Commenting on the dominance of Hyderabad in bagging top ranks in JEE, Bopanna, said, "Unlike Kota, in Hyderabad, we provide foundation training to students at the school level from Class 7 onwards, wherein basic concepts and fundamentals of JEE are taught. The daily routine of a student taking up coaching in Hyderabad is strenuous with more than half the day devoted to an intense study schedule."Few parents consider admission into one of the top coaching institutes in the city to be a passport to IIT. Owing to the frenzy, several coaching institutes in the city also conduct an admission test.However, educationalists don't consider the rigorous coaching at school level as a positive sign."Although students undergo rigorous training, the outcome at IITs is not always positive.Students often do not perform well when they come to IITs as they are trained in a certain manner. Reforms are required at the school level so that coaching for students is not encouraged at such a young age," said Sanjay G Dhande, an educationalist and former director of IIT Kanpur.

Q: Is there any method (other than ingestion) to tell whether a substance is LSD? A: The only way to definitively identify LSD is to do laboratory testing of the material. However, there are two primary field tests available. The first is a chemical reagent test called "Ehrlich's Reagent" which is available online from a variety of sources. It can identify indoles, of which LSD is one. It does not definitively identify LSD, but can identify that LSD is not present.

This document describes the process of collecting, processing and plotting ADS-B data received from nearby aircraft. Contact reddit.com/u/aarkebauer with any questions. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Overview I use a Raspberry Pi to collect and store the raw ADS-B data in a file. Data is collected using an inexpensive USB SDR antenna and is stored in the data file at 5 second intervals. A wide array of such antennas are available, and the one I use is the NooElec NESDR Mini SDR & DVB-T USB Stick. (http://www.nooelec.com/store/computer-peripherals/usb-ota-receivers/dvb-t-receivers/nesdr - mini-rtl2832-r820t.html) I then transfer this data file to my computer, where I have a bash script that deletes the 'data' folder in the current directory (explained below) and then runs a python program (dump1090plot.py) that takes creates a new file containing all data collected for each individual aircraft. The names of these files are the ICAO hex codes of the aircraft, and they are stored in a folder labeled 'data'. The program then looks at each of these files, makes lists of all position values (latitude, longitude, altitude) and filters out any "bad points," which I define as any points at which either altitude, latitude, or longitude data was NOT collected. The same python program then plots each of these lists of positions using matplotlib. There are several options that can be set in this program. They are described below, and are contained (with descriptions) within the program itself around line 155. Detailed descriptions of the setup and processes that occur are presented below. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Raspberry Pi Several items must be installed on the Raspberry Pi prior to collecting data. First, I installed dump1090, which will decode the ADS-B data obtained by the receiver (so named because ADS-B is broadcast at 1090 MHz). The following is the process I used to install this via command line on the Pi: sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade sudo su # to avoid writing sudo at the beginning of the following 6 commands <The following is one line> printf 'blacklist dvb_usb_rtl28xxu

Back in 1976, when Donald Trump first proposed to buy, gut, and then completely remodel New York's dilapidated Commodore Hotel on East 42nd Street, most dis-passionate observers, and some passionate ones, thought he should have his head examined. For the last six years of its life, the Commodore Hotel had lost $1.5 million per annum, and contributed not a penny to the city's tax coffers. The overall hotel-occupancy rate in New York had slipped to an abysmal 69 percent, and the city as a whole was teetering on its own financial tightrope. Donald's father, veteran real estate developer Fred C. Trump, recalls telling his son, "This is like trying to buy a ticket on the Titanic." But Donald, only 30 years old at the time, was not to be dissuaded from the project.

API microservices, the Unix philosophy, and the Richardson Maturity Model a practical perspective Why microservices After some time in the trenches I have come to believe that the engineering community needs to eliminate some FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) and NIH (Not Invented Here) thinking regarding microservices and API design. I have not conducted any statistically valid surveys so all of the following is personal opinion formed while on the job. Building APIs with a microservices approach allows teams to avoid several common pitfalls: Becoming encumbered by a monolithic centralized API that is at risk of reaching its maximum performance and hosting limits. This is when "vertical scaling" (e.g. throwing more RAM at it) can only go so far. Unless the monolith is a beautiful bonsai garden of multithreading or a romantic symphony of processes and queues, the crunch will come and it will not be pretty. Furthermore, the bigger and hairier a codebase becomes, the more expensive it is to develop due to reinvention of mundane things and a hockey stick-shaped learning curve for new teammates. Inflexible rules and restrictions on developer freedom and creativity. In order to rein-in an increasingly daunting beast of a monolith, standardization of practices is an excellent, if temporary bandaid fix. I'm not arguing against standardization. As a Python fan I love its culture of pragmatism and plainness. The pitfall to beware of is at the architectural level. The reason for this is that the right level of abstraction for "web service API" can be a moving target. When a team inherits a monolith in a system that does not already enforce common patterns, and is under pressure to scale the API to lower hosting costs or prevent additional outages, desperation can easily cloud judgement. When under pressure it can be tempting to go on "lock down" mode where past bad decisions become more entrenched to defend the pride of those who made them, at the expense of the product. Lock down mode is the definition of crazy, of valuing dumb and slow hard work over fast smart work. Lack of access to new engineers in the exact, arbitrary stack of choice. I recently witnessed a disaster waiting to happen in one team (whose company will remain nameless to protect the innocent). This team suffers from both pain points illustrated above. They brought me in to advise on architecture and after observation I prescribed microservices. There was intense interest and excitement from the engineers and founders who had never heard of this pattern before. The company has less than 18 months of runway before doing another funding round or dying. However, instead of entertaining a development model which would allow decomposing the monolith into separate services, they inexplicably decided to curl up and attempt to crawl back into the womb of Theoretically Appealing Concepts. The same concepts that resulted in a beast too burdensome to scale or improve, except by the two engineers who had been masochistically refactoring it for months. Examples are all in the form of "X all the things", where X may be "actors", "non-blocking async", "VM tuning", "stronger typing" etc. Those things may all be good in time, but they're also all going deeper into the abyss of risk right now. Inability to add new features in parallel to the permanent refactoring efforts that tie up the only senior engineers on the team. To me this sounds like a death knell. Refusal to increase traction with customers because of pride or delusion, especially when it's possible to do so while simultaneously reducing technical debt, is inconceivable. If only the non-technical cofounders or investors knew what was really going on. The microservices design approach is not a Theoretically Appealing Concept like "better multithreading will make an I/O-heavy web service scalable". Decomposing monolithic services into potentially many smaller ones is an architectural style that seems to work well in the real world. Kind of like REST. As with all software, abstractions are important, but they need to be the right ones for the problems being solved. From Eric S. Raymond's The Art of Unix Programming: "Developers should avoid writing big programs. This rule aims to prevent overinvestment of development time in failed or suboptimal approaches caused by the owners of the program's reluctance to throw away visibly large pieces of work. Smaller programs are not only easier to optimize and maintain; they are easier to delete when deprecated."

Originally, I wanted it to echo the file name to a file on a new line every time it was set and if the file had lines equal to the number of files in said directory, it would remove the list file and retouch it so it could be echo'd to again, but that ran into a few snags...so I went with method 2. Move the file after it was set and when the file count got to 1, move the last file and then move all the files back to the first directory.

Several lines of epidemiological studies have indicated that caffeine consumption and plasma uric acid (UA) level were negatively correlated with the incidence of some neurodegenerative diseases. We report here a novel mechanism by which these purine derivatives increase neuronal glutathione (GSH) synthesis. Intraperitoneal injection of caffeine or UA into male C57BL/6 mice significantly increased total GSH levels in the hippocampus. Neither SCH58261, an adenosine A2A receptor antagonist, nor rolipram, a phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor, increased GSH levels. Pretreatment with allopurinol, a drug to inhibit UA production, did not change the GSH level in the caffeine-treated mice. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons treated with caffeine or UA were resistant to oxidant exposure in the slice culture experiments. In experiments with the SH-SY5Y cell line, cysteine uptake was sodium-dependent and pretreatment with caffeine or UA increased cysteine uptake significantly as compared with the control conditions. Slice culture experiments using the hippocampus also showed increased cysteine and GSH contents after the treatment with caffeine or UA. Immunohistochemical analysis showed increased GSH levels in the hippocampal excitatory amino acid carrier-1 (EAAC1)-positive neurons of mice treated with caffeine or UA. These findings suggest that purine derivatives caffeine and UA induce neuronal GSH synthesis by promoting cysteine uptake, leading to neuroprotection.

A trapped juvenile transient (Bigg's) killer whale, named Sam (T046C2), was rescued on Thursday by Vancouver Aquarium and Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) scientists after having been stranded in remote Weeteeam Bay on Aristazabal Island, located on the central coast of British Columbia. The isolated area in which Sam was stranded – and his discovery through a happenstance visit by a DFO Cetacean Research team – makes this a very rare and fortuitous successful marine mammal rescue effort.
When it is a player's turn to make a move, the player can remove any number of buttons from only one line of buttons on the board. The initial button selection can be from any line on the board, but subsequent button selections must be from the same line from which the first button was removed. This behavior is implemented by using the gCurrentPlayLine variable. Before a player makes a first move, this variable is empty, once the player has made a move, this variable is assigned the line on which the button was stored. A test in the command described in this step test if gCurrentPlayLine is empty or if a value is set and matches the line number of the button to the value stored in the variable.

The remnants of Tropical Storm Lee moved northward from the southern Appalachians on the 6th to the middle Atlantic states on the 7th before stalling on the 8th. The moisture from Lee interacted with a frontal system to the west across the eastern Ohio Valley and eastern Great Lakes. In addition, moisture was drawn into New York and Pennsylvania from Hurricane Katia which was moving northward off the east coast in tandem with the remnants of Lee. This complicated scenario led to an extreme amount of rain for central New York and northeast Pennsylvania, most of which fell over a 48 hour period from the 6th to the 8th. Rainfall of 6 to 12 inches occurred over most of the upper Susquehanna river basin in New York and northeast Pennsylvania. The heavy rain caused massive, record breaking flooding on small streams, creeks and the Susquehanna River and its larger tributaries.

After most tragic events, it seems a lot of people need a Nostradamus-like figure to have "predicted" the events and present some sort of clarity to the vast conspiracy that is human existence. For Monday's horrific Boston marathon bombings, that widely-circulated "predictor" was a recent Family Guy episode titled "Turban Cowboy."

Oil pipeline leaks are bad. And that means pipeline operators and companies developing leak-sensing technologies are in a bind—they need to test their inventions without actually letting gunk seep into the earth. So they turn to a Canadian company called C-Fer Technologies. "There are few spots where you can dump oil on the ground," business development director Brian Wagg says. "We're giving them a place."

Most of us like to be associated with "idealistic" groups that claim that they are doing good, i.e., making the world better. However, this is usually not our strongest motive in choosing to associate with such groups. Instead, we more strongly want to make ourselves look good, and gain good-looking associations. Most idealistic groups quickly learn to cater to this demand by:
"They talk a lot. First, I was unhappy in the reserves, then it was an ankle injury, and I have to say every hour they invent a new story. "I can not speak the truth about what's happening with me and Liverpool. We have a problem. I'm resolving the issue. I'm expecting a call from my solicitor. I've returned to Miami now, where I was sorting out other business. I cannot say more than that."

The debate over nature versus nurture in relation to intelligence is not as clearly drawn as it was ten years ago, when geneticists claimed that intelligence is innate, while environmentalists claimed that culture is the major determining factor. Although the debate has not been resolved, it has been significantly refined. Robert Sternberg and Elena Grigorenko address the roles and interaction of nature and nurture in Intelligence, Heredity and Environment. This book provides a comprehensive, balanced, current survey of theory and research on the origins and transmission of human intelligence. The book is unique in the diversity of viewpoints it presents, and its inclusion of the very most recent theories and findings. It highlights the search for genes associated with specific cognitive abilities, interactionist theories, cultural relativism, educational strategies, developmental perspectives, and fallacies of previous intelligence research.

Kirby Ferguson made a name for himself with the popular series Everything is a Remix, in which he proposes that everything mankind creates takes inspiration from something that has come before. He gathers a mountain of evidence that backs up this point, and the topics range from simple borrowing to our complex legal system that doesn't acknowledge the derivative nature of creativity. In the TED talk embedded below, Kirby attempts to summarize a lot of his conclusions from the series.

1400 B.C., a tormented soul walked the Earth that was neither man nor god. Hercules was the powerful son of the god king Zeus. For this, he received nothing but suffering his entire life. After twelve arduous labors, and the death of his family, this dark, world-weary soul turned his back on the gods finding his only solace in bloody battle. Over the years, he warmed to the company of six similar souls, their only bond being their love of fighting, and the presence of death. These men and women never question where they go to fight, or why, or whom, just how much they will be paid. Now, the King of Thrace has hired these mercenaries to train his men to become the greatest army of all time. It is time for this bunch of lost souls to finally have their eyes opened to how far they have fallen, when they must train an army to become as ruthless and bloodthirsty as their reputation has become.

This watch is priced, from Elliot Havok, at $85. At that price, I would say you should get a great Timex watch instead. At the $29 WatchGang price, though? This was a steal. And, indeed, that is ultimately what WatchGang is all about. Perhaps not every month will you get a watch as good as some other months, but when you walk away with a watch that is worth triple what you paid for it, and you really like it and want to wear it — it's a pretty great feeling.

Melbourne City have pulled off a massive coup ahead of the Westfield W-League 2017/18 Season after signing Westfield Matildas forward Kyah Simon.
Jarman Impey has played 20 games for Port in each of the last two seasons, but may not be more than an adequate AFL-level player. He is very fast, applies decent defensive pressure (he was a defender until after 2015), but is prone to errors and drifting out of games.

We've all heard every pejorative description of fantasy sports: They're nerdy, dorky, a waste of time, an obsession, a literal wishful "fantasy," a reason significant others become abandoned for months at a time. Context depending, some of these accusations might even be true, but the disparagements miss the point: Fantasy sports have a vital social and emotional function. Men (and sports-inclined women, of course) may spend too much time on them at the expense of work and sanity, but we're not only being drawn away by the numbers and the competition — we're being drawn away by the opportunity and excuse to spend time with people we actually know and like.

This is a parkour map called "The Wall".Your goal is to climb a giant wall!- Play in 1.8.- Keep the difficulty at normal (it should be locked though).- Don't cheat, but you're free to use /kill whenever you want to.- Play in Adventure mode!- Use Save Points!- Look for hidden chests, which can contain food, diamonds, or emeralds (emeralds are used in the village shop).- A few chests are in places you can't get back from (without jumping down or killing yourself), so choose wisely if you really need that chest or not.- Use /kill if you get stuck somewhere or fall down without dying (you will only respawn at save points after dying).- Turn down the render distance if it lags.Please use the included music/sound pack! All music is made by me. The one sound effect is not.Also some people have been asking if it's OK to make videos of this map, and it definitely is, so go ahead :).Also, multiplayer should work fine on this map. There's a ton of food and a lot of chests(way more than you need actually...), and the save points are individual (using /spawnpoint).

Sarah Ryley at ProPublica has a fascinating, depressing, and exhaustive report on the NYPD's apparent ongoing civil rights abuses. Under the guise of policing "nuisance businesses," certain precincts are targeting minority-owned businesses -- usually small bodegas, laundromats, etc. -- with abatement actions that force owners to either lose their source of income or capitulate to the NYPD's overreaching demands.

(Newser) – Question: "You never came. Why?" Answer: "Because I don't love you anymore." That's just one example of the heartbreaking and heartbreakingly awkward posts shared on the latest Tumblr craze: The Last Message Received, reports Mashable. Curated by 15-year-old Emily Trunko, the Tumblr serves as a way for people to share final texts sent from exes, former besties, and love ones who've passed away. Emily, who also runs a Tumblr where people post anonymous letters, says the Last Message blossomed out of her fascination "with glimpses into the lives of other people," per Buzzfeed. "I thought that the last message sent before a breakup or before someone passed away would be really poignant." She was right.
This is my first time reading H.P. Lovecraft. I've always heard his name mentioned, particularly in reference to "The Call of Cthulhu," which is mentioned quite frequently in pop culture. I've seen Cthulhu stuffed animals, Cthulhu T-Shirts, and even World of Warcraft references H.P Lovecraft lore with their Ancient Ones. Anyway, I finally read his works, and I do have some mixed feelings about his writing style, but overall, I really liked this book.

In Kamathipura, Mumbai's oldest red-light district, it's estimated that there are currently some 20,000 sex workers doing business out of brothels.

Have you ever seen a movie that sends awful messages to kids, teenagers and adults? There are many inappropriate movies, and TV shows for that matter, that do this. Yet, there has been a break from the norm. "Finding Dory," the sequel to "Finding Nemo," came out on June 17th, 2016. There's been a lot of hype over this movie. Many kids born in the 90s, who are now young adults, ran to the movie theater to see "Finding Dory" since "Finding Nemo" was a childhood classic. Let's just say, you would not want to go to the theater when it was the first day this movie was out. And if you did, I'm sorry.

New Orleans is transforming. The city's poorly constructed levees meant that when Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, it devastated the city, bringing in floodwaters that forced out residents and flattened neighborhoods. It also created an opportunity for developers and politicians to remake it anew. After the storm, New Orleans was often described as a "blank slate," which was problematic given hundreds of thousands of residents still lived within city limits. But for those who could afford to buy, demolish, and build, the term held some truth to it.

It would also become an interesting tourist attraction for comic book fans visiting our city.

A comment appeared from Dave Burton which included some nonsense trying to claim that the Antarctic sea ice gain is more important for climate than the much greater Arctic loss. He happened to be the same Dave Burton associated with "NC-20," a group which tried to get the North Carolina state legislature to outlaw any official use of sea level rise forecasts other than the extrapolation of a linear trend based on past observations.

A report by an independent think tank has suggested that sales of plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles may overtake those of diesel as soon as 2019. The Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit analysed sales figures to produce the date, which is based on rapidly declining diesel sales – and a large uptake in alternatively fuelled plug-in vehicles.
One of five city councillors behind the expected firing of the city's transit chief suggested Sunday that more senior transit managers may lose their jobs for not "respecting the office of the mayor." "We will discuss whether removing some managers — and it may in fact be three, four, five — we may discuss whether that's the way to go," said Frank Di Giorgio, a TTC commissioner allied with Mayor Rob Ford, and one of the councillors who called a special TTC board meeting for Tuesday where it is believed chief general manager Gary Webster will be sacked.

The current flag of archipelago of St. Kitts and Nevis has been used since 1983 and it is composed of a sheet, which is divided by a black diagonal stripe into a green and a red field. In addition, the black stripe is framed by narrower yellow stripes and it also bears two white five-pointed star. The stars may indicate the two main islands, but according to the official interpretation it represents freedom and hope. The green color of the upper left field symbolizes the fertile soil of the islands and the red field serves as a reminder of the struggle for independence. The yellow color indicates the local bright sun and the black stripe represents the dark-skinned population. The islands were named in 1493 by Christopher Columbus during his voyage to India.
As I headed home from the first annual GaymerX I was that person on mass transit—the one wearing sunglasses underground to obscure my face due to feelings. Not "feels," actual damn feelings. "Feels" come and go; "feelings" need to be processed, reflected on. This meant I had to throw out my initial concept of what this write-up was going to be and instead, hopefully, capture the importance of GaymerX on a different level than merely panel content.
In the hours leading up to every fifth Dodgers game, there's a simple rule that everyone in the clubhouse must follow: Do NOT, under any circumstances, talk to Clayton Kershaw.

Apparently, the TAC 1s was Gayle Bradley's first attempt at a tactical folder design, hence the abbreviation which stands for 'tactical folder 1 (for) Spyderco'. The flipper seemed a bit long, but it worked very well and it offered a good guard when the blade was locked. I liked the contoured finish and surface pattern of the handle scales. The knife looks straight and metallic, but with those two design features, the thin TAC 1s handled much better than you'd expect from its looks. The TAC 1s looked like the type of tactical folder you could carry all day in a suit or regular clothes and forget you have it on you, until it's needed.

Dermatophagia is a medical condition or compulsive form of behavior that is characterized by biting one's skin. The term is formed from the joining of the Greek words for "skin" and "to eat." The most common site of the biting is the skin around the finger nails. Dermatophagia is classified as a type of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), which is an anxiety disorder that includes compulsion, obsession and uneasiness as some of its major characteristics. Dermatophagia, like other disorders of its ilk, is more common in females than in males.

After laying claim to another impressive season with 47 home runs in 2015, leading MLB, Davis is aimed to make upwards of 6 years/$144 million based on reports from MLB Trade Rumors.

Originally the Japanese term for "house (more specifically, your house" in the honorific form of the language, made by adding the prefix " o- " to the word for house " taku ." It can also be used as an honorific second-person pronoun.Today, the word has taken on a different meaning: it refers to a person who has had or is in the middle of having an intense hobby, which is usually added before the word itself. See the example below (1).The connotation of the term varies in relation to the speaker and how much said speaker knows about the actual context in which it should be used. Especially common among American fans, an otaku is simply a very devoted follower (2). However, the word has a harsher, more negative connotation in Japanese. It is a term that refers to the receiver of the description is a very reclusive sociopathic person who has a severe addiction to any form of media and (in some cases) will rarely, if ever, leave his or her house to meet minimal living requirements or obtain more of said media (hence the term otaku derived from its original meaning refering to a house)(3). It is not to be confused with the term " hikikomori ," or a person/people who has/have withdrawn from society. It is a dire insult, especially to those who do not actually fit the category of otaku. Otaku (plural) are generally looked down upon in Japanese society, constantly derided for their passions . These insults may or may not have a penny's worth of truth, but they base themselves in preconceived notions of how previous people of obsession have acted. The otaku do receive a lot of scorn from their fellow peers, and hate crimes against them are not all that uncommon (4). Nevertheless, the word is not completely negative. For example, the largest anime/manga/ East Asian convention in the United States is named " Otakon ", and there is also the American-based " A-kon " (5). Several people worldwide have made attempts to remove its negative connotation, but have not been completely successful.

In 2015, New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez was indicted on bribery charges. Prosecutors alleged that he accepted nearly $1 million in bribes through campaign donations, vacations, and private jet flights in return for doing political favors for a Florida optometrist, Salomon Melgen, a co-defendant in the case. In April 2017, Melgen was found guilty of Medicare fraud. Menendez pressed Obama's Health and Human Services secretary for leniency in the case. In addition, Menendez also tried to use his political influence to coerce U.S. officials to pressure the Dominican Republic to benefit one of Melgen's companies. He also intervened in acquiring visas for Melgen's foreign girlfriends. Since 2014, Menendez has raised $4.6 million for legal expenses and has continued to raise campaign funds for his re-election bid in 2018.

Having the best of anything is a sort of societal dream. We have tons of things that we would love to have here. We have even more items in our possession. While we might have a lot of personal property we often settle for lower quality products or knockoff products simply because we can't afford the best item. Such is life. But what if I were to tell you that there is a way that you could have the best electronic cigarette? And what if I told you that the best way to do this would be to set up an RSS feed? The truth of the matter is that an RSS feed could be the best tool for you to track the best electronic cigarette all across the web. Allow me to explain this process.

The first time I took an international trip alone, I was faking it. Well, it's not like 20-year-old me pretended to fly to Paris and travel across Europe to visit a friend in Budapest. After failing to land a summer newspaper internship, I impulse-bought a plane ticket I couldn't afford. The deception was there from the start: For some reason I lied and told everyone it was a great deal. It wasn't. I told my parents I had enough money to see the trip through. I didn't. I told my then-boyfriend I was super excited about it, that I knew how to have fun alone. I didn't. I swore up and down that it wasn't a big deal that I didn't speak French or German or Hungarian and had no clue about the culture in most places I'd be traveling. I'd never been out of the U.S. before.

Toula Portokalos is 30, Greek, and works in her family's restaurant, Dancing Zorba's, in Chicago. All her father Gus wants is for her to get married to a nice Greek boy. But Toula is looking for more in life. Her mother convinces Gus to let her take some computer classes at college (making him think it's his idea). With those classes under her belt, she then takes over her aunt's travel agency (again making her father think it's his idea).

Her father is livid over her dating a non-Greek. He has to learn to accept Ian; Ian has to learn to accept Toula's huge family, and Toula has to learn to accept herself.

Choi Jong Soo and I are driving down a two-lane highway surrounded by rice fields, acres and acres of them, lying fallow for the winter. A few miles in the distance are mountains that seem too steep and jagged for their modest heights. We pass checkpoints, roadblocks. Heavily armed soldiers eye us from small huts. Every so often, helicopters sweep overhead. We are in the Cheorwon Basin, a little more than two hours northeast of Seoul, South Korea, and less than one mile from the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, the 2.5-mile-wide no man's land that separates North and South Korea. Choi, my guide, nods at the mountains. "North Korea," he says. "Very close."

A Special Edition NYC panel on Transgender themes in comic books took that idea head on and the subject was far broader than I expected.

Objective The present investigation examined whether increased overtime work predicts impairment in cognitive performance in the domains of attention, executive function, and mood. Methods The behavioral and cognitive functions of 248 automotive workers were measured by a neurobehavioral test performance. Overtime, defined as number of hours worked greater than 8 h a day or greater than 5 d a week, was calculated from company payroll records for the week before the test day. The number of consecutive days worked before the test day was also determined. Results Cross-sectional data analysis by multiple linear regression, after adjustment for the effects of age, education, gender, alcohol intake, repeated grade in school, acute petroleum naphtha exposure, shift worked, job type, number of consecutive days worked before the test day, and number of hours worked on the test day before the testing, demonstrated that increased overtime was significantly associated with impaired performance on several tests of attention and executive function. Increased feelings of depression, fatigue, and confusion were also associated with increased overtime work. In addition significant interaction effects were observed for job type but not for naphtha exposure. Conclusions The findings support the hypothesis that overtime work results in impaired cognitive performance in the areas of attention and executive function and that both overtime hours and the number of consecutive days worked prior to a test day affect mood.

A determined Congress chief Sonia Gandhi kept a stern lookout from her front-row seat and so her party MPs valiantly held up outsized placards and hoped for the best.Congress leader in Lok Sabha Mallikarjuna Kharge beckoned Adhir Ranjan Chaudhary – the MP who had earned a day's suspension earlier in the week – and handed out some cloves. The traditional remedy might keep voices supple but itmay not be enough to sustain protests with Speaker Sumitra Mahajan and the government switching tactics and insisting on proceedings despite the disruptions.To the dismay of Congress MPs, more than the usual 20 MPs had their say during zero hour and the volume of the protests failed to drown out the House microphones.At Congress's meeting of party MPs on Friday morning, most speakers, sensing the mood of the leadership, pitched for continuation of protests. It was, however, decided that home minister Rajnath Singh be allowed to make a statement on the Gurdaspur terror attacks. This move, too, seemed to backfire as Singh went on give what Congress called a political speech, blaming UPA's "lax" security policies while Kharge had to wait till afternoon to have his say.Congress, lacking in lung power, sought some help from Trinamool Congress that has a well-earned reputation for bringing the House down with redoubtable talents like Kalyan Banerjee in its ranks.However, Trinamool has watched but not risen. Efforts of Congress leaders to urge Trinamool to jettison its neutrality and lend its powerful voice to the protests failed to move the West Bengal contingent.The small Samajwadi Party group in Lok Sabha has clearly charted a different path with party boss Mulayam Singh Yadav making no secret of his view that he did not support Congress's demand that foreign minister Sushma Swaraj quit over the Lalit Modi episode.The larger regional blocs, like BJD and AIADMK, have voiced their demand that the government take the initiative to break the logjam but this has brought little succour to Congress and these parties did not join the protests either.The government has now called an all-party meeting on Monday but going by the animosity in the House, the prospects of a rapprochement are bleak.
A wall with peeling paint can be an unsightly mess in a home, causing a homeowner embarrassment and frustration. If paint peels from an interior wall, the reason for the peeling paint is often an improperly prepared surface and moisture seeping through from the wall to the paint surface. Repaint a wall with peeling paint to repair and restore the wall and make it attractive again.
There is nothing harder than the creation of fictional character. I can tell it from the number of apprentice novels I read that begin with descriptions of photographs. You know the style: "My mother is squinting in the fierce sunlight and holding, for some reason, a dead pheasant. She is dressed in old-fashioned lace-up boots, and white gloves. She looks absolutely miserable. My father, however, is in his element, irrepressible as ever, and has on his head that grey velvet trilby from Prague I remember so well from my childhood." The unpractised novelist cleaves to the static, because it is much easier to describe than the mobile: it is getting these people out of the aspic of arrest and mobilised in a scene that is hard.

There's Another Cow Off the Ice One of the tactics often used for solving intractable mathematical and physical problems is to simplify it until it does become solvable. Thus, we might assume an infinite surface rather than one with boundaries for the simple, if inconvenient, fact that physical systems grow irritable at the boundaries.  Or we might suppose a frictionless surface, an ideal gas, a perfectly elastic collision.  Think of the phrase "all else being equal."  They never are, but by assuming they are we might gain some insight into the more complex reality.  Ptolemy (and Copernicus) solved the orbits of each planet as a separate problem, and wound up with each planet orbiting a different center.
Donald Trump spent much of 2016 questioning his opponent's stamina to be president of the United States. But it is now Trump's own fitness that is being scrutinized by friends and foes alike. After Trump spent recent weeks creating a level of chaos unseen around the White House since Richard Nixon's resignation in 1974, Capitol Hill politicians and media outlets are quietly questioning whether Trump is fit for the highest office in the land. That the commander in chief slurred his way through the end of a speech on Jerusalem Wednesday was just the latest in a string of unsettling incidents.

The Cowboys have never quite been able to work out their two tight end package. Since Jason Witten was drafted and originally paired with Dan Campbell under Bill Parcells, the team has tried and tried to work dual tight ends into its offense to no avail. The Cowboys drafted tight ends with three separate second-round picks, and all fell by the wayside, including the first three years of the career of Gavin Escobar. The most enigmatic of all of these picks? Martellus Bennett.

There's been a propaganda war going on over who will produce Apple's next generation processors. Every time that there's a report that TSMC will retain Apple's chip business, a counter report is soon to follow stating the contrary. In late December it was reported that GlobalFoundries was experiencing tooling delays . So today, to counter that report, magically Samsung will gain 70% of Apple's A9 business with GlobalFoundries only being used as Samsung's "backup fab." How convenient is a report like that to skirt the issues surrounding GlobalFoundries. Tailor made wouldn't you say? Nonetheless, the latest rumor gives Apple's business to Samsung until there's another one to contradict it.
Sensory play is super important in the early months and years of life, and for that reason I bring you, gel sensory bags! They can be stimulating for the eyes, hands, nose and even the tongue... but let's be sure to keep these out of our children's mouths as they are NOT edible! You will need: - a tub of cheap hair gel - Ziploc bags (I removed the white paint labels on each of the bags with a cotton ball dipped in nail polish remover - it wipes right off, no hassel) - food coloring - masking tape - random small objects (marbles, beads, squishy balls, glitter, etc.) 1. Scoop three or four large spoonfuls of gel into each bag. 2. Put a couple of drops of your preferred food coloring into each bag. (You really only need one bag, but you can make as many as you'd like.) 3. Drop some objects into the bags and seal them up. You'll want to seal the bags extra with the masking tape... trust me, I didn't. And you're all done! You'll want to supervise your little one while he plays with his sensory bag/s since it's possible to poke holes in them or rip them apart with little teeth! Happy learning!

Senior advocate Raju Ramachandran, appointed by the Supreme Court to investigate allegations of Narendra Modi's complicity in the Gujarat riots, has said that there appear to be enough grounds for offences to be made out against the chief minister. Mr Ramachandran's report, submitted to the Supreme Court in February this year, says that "the offences which can be made out against Shri Modi, at this prima facie stage" include "promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion and acts prejudicial to (the) maintenance of harmony." (Read Ramachandran's entire report here). Mr Ramachandran's findings differ from those of a Special Investigation Team (SIT) that was asked to determine whether Mr Modi should be tried for his alleged role in the riots. The team ruled there was no "prosecutable evidence" against the chief minister in a report submitted to a Gujarat court in April. The SIT and Mr Ramachandran were both asked to study Mr Modi's role on the basis of a case filed by Zakia Jafri. Her husband and former Congress MP Ehsan Jafri was set on fire during the riots. Mrs Jafri has said that Mr Modi was among 63 people who colluded to prevent assistance to those being attacked in the riots.Mr Ramachandran says that more attention should be paid to the claims of suspended police officer Sanjiv Bhatt, whose comments against the chief minister were dismissed by the SIT. Mr Bhatt claims that on February 27, 2002, hours after 58 passengers were set on fire in a train near the Godhra station, Mr Modi held a meeting at his residence with senior police officers and told them that Hindus should be allowed to "vent their anger."The SIT felt Mr Bhatt's allegations are without merit because other officers at the meeting said that he was not at that session, and because he shared this information nine years after the riots took place. However, Mr Ramachandran says, "There is no documentary material of any nature whatsoever which can establish that Shri Bhatt was not present in the meeting on 27.02.2002." He says that in the absence of minutes of this meeting, "it is the word of Shri Bhatt against the word of other officers, senior to him."Mr Ramachandran says, "The law and order meeting in question was called by the Chief Minister at about 11:00 pm. It seems quite natural for an officer from the Intelligence to be called... The phone call records do not contradict the statement given by Shri Bhatt to the SIT."The senior advocate records, "I disagree with the conclusion of the SIT that Shri Bhatt should be disbelieved at this stage itself. On the other hand, I am of the view that Shri Bhatt needs to be put through the test of cross-examination, as do the others who deny his presence. Mr Ramachandran does offer a health warning about the suspended police officer saying his behavior has "not been that of a detached police officer who is content with giving his version. I am left with no doubt that he is actively 'strategizing', and is in touch with those who would benefit or gain mileage from his testimony. But these factors, in my view, cannot be grounds for ignoring his statement at this stage."Mr Ramachandran says records establish that two senior ministers were placed in police control rooms on February 28, as the riots swelled. He says that though the SIT has found that they did not interfere with the police's functioning, "There is the possibility that the very presence of these two ministers had a dampening effect on the senior police officials." He underscores, "While there is no direct material to show how and when the message of the Chief Minister was conveyed to the two ministers, the very presence of political personalities unconnected with the Home Portfolio at the Police Control Rooms is circumstantial evidence of the Chief Minister directing, requesting or allowing them to be present."Standing by Mr Modi, the Bharatiya Janata Party said the law is guided by due process and not the opinion of an amicus curiae (who assists the court) or any lawyer. "There is no provision under Code of Criminal Procedure or the Evidence Act for the opinion of a lawyer or an amicus curiae. Investigation is exclusively a police function and not a lawyer's function. Police is trained for investigations but a lawyer is not," senior BJP leader Arun Jaitley said.

India recently put up three coal blocks with 500 million tonnes of reserves, much of which was steel making coal, up for auction and got 36 applications. No wonder iron ore miners like Vale (NYSE:VALE) and Rio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) are excited about the emergence of India.

Homeschooling--that is, parent-led home-based education--is an age-old traditional educational practice that a decade ago appeared to be cutting-edge and "alternative" but is now bordering on "mainstream" in the United States. It may be the fastest-growing form of education in the United States. This article describes the following findings regarding home education: (1) General facts and trends regarding homeschooling; (2) Reasons for home educating; (3) Academic performance comparisons between institutionally-schooled and home-educated students; (4) Social, emotional, and psychological development; (5) Gender differences in children who are home educated; and (6) Success in the "Real World" of adulthood. Research designs to date do not conclusively "prove" that homeschooling causes these statistical findings. At the same time, there is no empirical evidence that homeschooling causes negative results compared to institutional schooling. Future research may better answer the question of causation.

Because I wanted to use a significant amount of whole wheat flour, I added additional water to the dough. The original recipe, I believe, was only 350 grams of water, but that was for an entirely white flour bread. The whole wheat flour is more thirsty. So 76 percent hydration instead of 70 percent.  The recipe is an adaptation of J. Kenji Lopez-Alt's recipe on Serious Eats , for which he is the managing culinary director, a job I could never hold, for too many reasons to list.   Ingredients 380g water 20g starter 300g bread flour 200g whole wheat flour 9.5g salt Day one Late afternoon, mixed all ingredients together thoroughly and covered. No kneading, no stretch and folds. Just waiting. Right after mixing, of course, I think it would have been nice to have done a soaker with the whole wheat flour. Day two The dough has sat out for 21.5 hours, some in a cool kitchen, but not freezing winter cold, and some in a warm daytime kitchen. Dough pretty puffy. I put the dough in the fridge. Day three - All day in the fridge. Real life delays dough-related tasks. Day four Baking day! Preheated oven, with dutch oven inside, to 475 degrees for one hour. Wary of heating oven to 500 with dutch oven after disaster of last loaf and bread entirely stuck. Right before baking, I removed dough from fridge,  shaped,   sprinkled flour on bottom and flaxseed meal on top (did not weigh any of that). Did a couple of slashes on top. Removed lid of dutch oven at 30 minutes. Total baking time of 52 minutes, amply demonstrating my patience, admittedly won with the use of the internal thermometer. To my credit, however, I am checking the temperature of the bread much less often, thereby reducing loss of heat from an open oven door for a minute or so.  Gorgeous, a little burnt on top, but a marvelous crust. A great taste and an easy bread that I shared with my writers' group. Definitely, a yummm .... mmy on this one. Deserves a couple of extra photos 2/3 to 108 Number 72 is two-thirds of the way to 108. Too busy to celebrate at the moment. That goes on the post-Passover list as well. At the beginning, I could not imagine getting this far; so very committed of me.

The Idea in Brief What's really behind corporate-accounting scandals? They stem less from deliberate corruption than from a deeper, more pernicious problem: unconscious biases built into our auditing system. Due to the often subjective nature of accounting and tight relationships between accounting firms and their clients, even honest, meticulous auditors can unintentionally distort the numbers—misleading investors, regulators, and even management. But new "corporate accountability" laws and threats of jail time won't solve the problem. The situation demands far more aggressive action than the U.S. government has taken. True auditor independence requires fundamental changes in how the accounting industry operates. Companies must acknowledge the existence of bias—and embrace practices and regulations that temper its ill effects. Only then can all players trust companies' financial reports. The Idea in Practice Because of the self-serving bias, we tend to reach conclusions we're highly motivated to reach. We unconsciously discount facts contradicting our position and uncritically embrace evidence supporting it. Three structural aspects of accounting produce bias among auditors: Ambiguity. People tend to reach self-serving conclusions whenever ambiguity surrounds evidence. Many accounting decisions—such as what constitutes an expense, when revenue should be recognized—require subjective interpretations of ambiguous information. Attachment. Auditors are highly motivated to remain in clients' good graces and approve their accounts. Why? Clients can fire them for delivering unfavorable audits. Also, long-term relationships enable auditing firms to sell more lucrative consulting services. Approval. Bias intensifies when people endorse others' biased judgment—provided it aligns with their own bias. Thus, auditors may accept more aggressive accounting from clients than what they themselves might suggest independently. Three aspects of human nature amplify bias: Familiarity. People are more willing to harm strangers (such as anonymous investors) than individuals they know (long-term clients, for example). The deeper the auditor/client ties, the stronger the tendency toward approving dubious accounting. Discounting. We tend to be much more responsive to immediate consequences than to delayed, uncertain ones. Auditors may hesitate to issue critical reports because of possible immediate damage to the relationship, loss of the contract, or unemployment. Escalation. People often explain away minor indiscretions—then conceal the growing problem. In accounting, unconscious bias can evolve into conscious corruption. Radical Remedies Current government reforms—stricter accounting standards, conflict-of-interest disclosure—don't address the roots of self-serving bias. Instead, we must eliminate the incentives that spawn bias—by reducing auditors' interest in whether clients are pleased with their reports. Some suggestions: Completely bar auditors from providing consulting and tax services to clients. Accounting firms that advise clients on how to boost profits, while trying to impartially judge their books, face an impossible conflict of interest. Remove the threat of being fired for delivering unfavorable audits: Design limited auditor/client contracts through which auditors cannot be fired. Prohibit rehiring auditors at the contract's end. Instead, require major accounting firms to rotate clients. Prohibit clients from hiring accountants who have audited them. Auditors can't be impartial while trying to please prospective employers.

Government officials in Japan's southern prefecture of Miyazaki are alarmed after genetic tests on dead chickens on a farm confirmed the presence of a highly pathogenic bird flu virus. Prefectural officials have culled 42,000 chickens on the farm and set up 10 sterilization points around the facility. This is the second outbreak in the country within the month of December, with the previous being a Dec. 16 confirmed case of the H5N8 virus, also in Miyazaki. Roughly 4,000 chickens were culled during that episode. Miyazaki's current outbreak has also tested positive for the H5 virus strain.

Once its $2 billion Home Shopping Network merger is finalized, the emerged QVC Group will become the third-largest e-commerce retailer in North America in terms of sales, trailing only Amazon and Walmart, according to QVC chief executive Michael A. George. That's huge. Amid all the chatter about Amazon HQ2, it seems important to note that the region has an e-commerce player like QVC in its midst. With a few caveats: It's not actually within city limits and only a tiny fraction of its soon-to-be 27,000 employees will work in the region. (Might QVC open an office in the city to attract tech talent, the way suburban companies like Vanguard and social network MeetMe have?) And of course, the merger is still pending so it's too early to say if QVC could truly challenge Amazon or Walmart.
Kodiak Bandito represents a rustic full grain leather with a lightly oiled feel. These huge leather sides have occasional brands and healed scars that add rich character and really enhance the rustic style of these hides. Hides are very soft and the combination of oils & waxes in the finish give the hides natural resistance to weather and moisture.

An expeditionary team from the Russian Arctic National Park has just found a secret Nazi base named 'Schatzgraber' or 'Treasure Hunter' in the Arctic. The team found more than 500 objects of historical value in the ruins of what was once a Nazi base, said to have been built to search the arctic for ancient artifacts. The secret base is believed to have been one of the many sites built by the Nazi's in their quest for supremacy.

Originally I was gonna make this where the woman present is the second wife and so any cheating that occurs only applies to the first wife, but I realized my initial wording wasn't clear enough and I couldn't figure out the proper wording to make it work without getting too long-winded. The heart of the problem is that no one has come up with a word for "secret second wife". Someone should get on that. I'm lookin' at you, rappers!
NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is on track to grow at a 1.8 percent annualized pace in the first quarter after data showed slower-than-expected growth in consumer spending in January, the Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDP Now forecast model showed on Wednesday.

On June 9, Judge Johnson of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in Australia passed a landmark judgment. Shabbir Vaziri, a senior Bohra priest, was sentenced to 11 months in jail for promoting, perpetuating and enforcing the practice of female genital mutilation (FGM) in the community. This was the first case in history in which Bohras, including a mother and a nurse, were prosecuted for conducting FGM on two small girls. The four-year-long trial concluded with the sentencing verdict, at which jail time was handed out to the priest, while a much more lenient sentence of home detention was enforced on the mother of the two girls and the 80-year-old nurse who performed the procedure. Clearly, the judge differentiated between the mother and nurse, who were forced to perpetuate the practice and the priest – a representative of the clergy – who actively enforced the continuation of FGM in the community.

I met a wise man when I was in my 50s, a brilliant Filipino with great experience born out of special circumstances. It was an advantage that he was more than well-schooled and ended up with a host of degrees and doctorates. But most of all, he was in the right place at the right time at crucial junctures of our history. He parlayed natural intelligence and personal experience into deep and strategic insights.
This drama is about how people think that they have the power to control money, but they're actually being ruled by it. The power of capital is so great that it is involved in every aspect of the society. People do almost anything to protect the money they have and they turn into complete maniacs when they see a tiny loss.

Neuropsychologic follow-up studies of a 5 1/2-year-old boy who had left hemispherectomy for seizures showed that he had developed superior language and intellectual abilities. These findings contrast with recent reports indicating that the plasticity of the nervous system may have been overrated and contradict reports of restricted development of language functions after left and of nonlanguage functions after right hemispherectomy for perinatal lateralized brain lesions. Following removal of the left hemisphere, including "the classical language zones," the right hemisphere and other intact residual structures may provide the necessary substrata for the development of above normal adult language and intellectual capacities.

All the tears from the so called hard core raiders are amazing to me. Crying about grinding normal for gear to run savage...aw sorry you can't just walk into the top tier raid.To be blunt, YOU choose to grind gear in savage. There are other gearing options, but they require a bit more patience than you are willing to show. Oh, but you'll whine that the story in normal mode is the same as Savage and once you've seen it in Normal there is no more incentive to run Savage...except that it sure as hell seems to me that if seeing the story once destroys your incentive to run savage, you'll only ever run it once anyway. Except of course that's not the case since you'll want the gear, minion, mount and title to show how great you are.So really what is the complaint? Perhaps you are just too impatient to gear up more gradually, and find Savage too difficult without tip-top gear. In which case welcome to the world of every 'casual' player looking at Coil, knowing they'll need HW gear and the echo to get through. How does it feel to be faced with content you're not good enough to beat without mechanically over gearing it?I think this boils down to Savage being hard enough that even 4 different carrots on a stick are insufficient incentive for wannabe raiders to just run the content, so instead they come here to cry about Normal and demand that filthy casuals be locked out of their precious raid content again. When the truth is, the top tier raiders are farming Savage and the intermediate raiders are either just getting on with grinding gear for Savage, or crying in their mead over repitition (the grind) killing their incentive.All these so called solutions serve to do Is nothing but place intermediate raiders above/ahead of the general population of the game. Perhaps this is when the pro'bro' raider should whisper 'git gud' in your ear?

In the video for "KV Crimes", a highlight from his 2013 album Wakin on a Pretty Daze, Kurt Vile rode around Philadelphia on a throne, his flowing brown locks topped with a plastic crown. He was fed a royal meal of a Wawa hoagie, he sleepily waved at followers, and he rolled his eyes at giggling sycophants. The critical acclaim for the record justified his place as the slacker king of Philly, but even as he rode the wave of adoration, he seemed aloof — the endearing, lovable kind that seems inherently tied to his dazed, hazed stream-of-consciousness songwriting. Even at the top of his game, Vile couldn't sit contentedly; existential questions and anxieties still rattled around in his head. So it should come as no surprise that follow-up b'lieve i'm goin down… finds Vile continuing to self-deprecate, amble, and sigh, despite the new tier of success. Neither should it be a surprise that all those qualities remain entirely charming.
Brandon Knight and the rest of his Milwaukee Bucks teammates noticed that coach Jason Kidd had been on the phone for a good while during the final practice before last February's trade deadline, leading to a playful guessing game that one of them would be on the move. To Knight, the banter was hilarious. In his mind there was no way the Bucks would break up a group that was in the playoff hunt 10 months after a 15-win season and had won eight of nine games entering the All-Star break despite losing Jabari Parker to a knee injury and Larry Saunders to an early retirement.

Bruce Willis and Tracy Morgan team up for the Warner Bros. police buddy movie Cop Out in this Kevin Smith-directed production. From a script by Robb and Mark Cullen, the story centers around police detectives Jimmy (Willis), a no-B.S. divorced dad, and Paul (Morgan), a crazy-talking loose cannon. Despite nine years as partners, the two lawmen can still sometimes seem like polar opposites -- especially when Paul's unpredictable antics get them suspended without pay. Already strapped for cash and trying to pay for his daughter's wedding, Jimmy decides to sell a rare baseball card that's worth tens of thousands. Unfortunately, when the collector's shop is robbed and the card vanishes with the crook, Paul and Jimmy end up going rogue, tracking down the card and the drug ring behind its theft, all on their own time, and without any backup -- except for each other. ~ Cammila Collar, Rovi

Thanks to Finnish artist Jirka Vtinen, we can now confirm that Disney's cartoon villains would look just as scary in real life. In honor of Halloween, the illustrator decided to expand his portfolio of iconic princesses and princes by adding the wickedly witchy villains from classic Disney films like Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, and The Little Mermaid. There's the Evil Queen, who looks as though she's just had a run-in with her Magic Mirror; Maleficent and Hades, who have perfected their evil smirk; as well as Ursula, Gaston, and Captain Hook flaunting an ominously toothy grin. Aside from their sinister expressions, Vtinen perfectly captured each of their wicked personalities through his use of deep, rich colors and spooky shadowing.

Literate Twitter found the perfect analogy to shatter the shady rhetoric of #Gamergate ("it's not about misogyny, it's about ethics in gaming journalism!"), once and for all. #Readergate seems to have started on Wednesday by writer Tauriq Moosa and friends after a recent essay in the Daily Beast on harassment and is spreading rapidly. The joke involves taking the most common, petulant arguments from the #Gamergate "movement" and applying them to books and authors. #Readergate tweets might fly over the heads of many #Gamergate defenders, but to anyone who reads, they handily illustrate the point that insisting a genre of art or entertainment be untouchable by cultural criticism is patently absurd. The brazen misogyny in many of those arguments becomes obvious when applied to books, too. Most important, the jokes are great.

My husband had to borrow money from a neighbour so that we could afford the tests and treatment. In two days, thank God, he was better - Omar stayed with us."

The full sordid tale of spite, scholarly selfishness, and undisguised anti-Semitism, which kept access to the Dead Sea texts restricted for decades to a tiny cartel, unwinds in his pages. —Paula Fredriksen , New Republic ,

The Medic or Assault Specialist is the tritaginest in the Battlefield Friends series. He appears to be the most laid-back among the squad, he does not yell at the Noob as often as his other squadmates do, and actually is more encouraging toward the Noob's attempted grasp of how the world of Battlefield works, during the Season 2 premier "Chopper Expert", the Medic had some confidence in the Noob's newfound ability to fly to an extent (although, he does show some sarcasm when something goes wrong in the game and that is usually pointed towards the Noob). In addition to his above average patience and mellow attitude, the Medic is shown to be a team player. In the "Silent Sniper" he watches over the Recon's "six" while he snipes, in "Full Tank" he effectively serves as a gunner for the squad's tank, killing an enemy that attempted to place C4 on the tank. His aptitude in infantry combat is displayed in "Claymore Specialist" by his ability to singlehandedly eliminate an entire squad of enemy medics.

NEW DELHI: A key conspirator, Farooq Mohammad Bhana, in the 2002 Godhra train burning case was on Wednesday arrested by the Gujarat ATS.Bhana was on the run for the last 14 years after the 2002 Sabarmati Express train burning incident in which 59 people were killed.An ATS official said that Bhana was one of the key accused, who hatched the conspiracy to burn the train at Godhra Railway Station on February 27, 2002.The incident triggered large scale communal riots in the state in which around 1,000 people were killed.According to the ATS officials, Bhana was a corporator in Godhra when the incident took place. To evade arrest, he then moved to Mumbai where he became a property broker."Based on a tip-off, we nabbed Bhana at a toll plaza near Kalol town of Panchmahal district when he was going to Godhra from Mumbai today. He was the key conspirator of Godhra carnage," an ATS official said.In the FIR, Bhana was charged with conspiracy to put the S-6 coach on fire during a meeting with others accused at the Aman Guest House near Godhra Railway Station.He, along with another corporator Bilal Haji, allegedly instructed the others accused to put the train coach on fire as per the instruction received from Maulana Umerji, who was arrested as a mastermind behind the incident but was later released.A special court had in March 2011 pronounced death penalty for the 11 people convicted in the Godhra train burning case. 20 others were handed life imprisonment.(With inputs from PTI)

Despite of the fact that the impact of various stressful stimuli on catecholamine biosynthetic enzyme gene expression, activity and immunoreactive protein has been intensively studied, less is known about the aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC), the enzyme, which catalyzes decarboxylation of L-dihydroxyphenylalanine to dopamine. We focused on the identification of AADC mRNA and immunoprotein in various mice tissues and detected both in selected mice neuronal tissues (adrenal medulla, sympathetic stellate and cervical ganglia) and also in non-neuronal tissues (liver, spleen, kidney and all four parts of the heart). Surprisingly, although we failed to detect AADC mRNA in mice thymus, lungs and abdominal fat, we found presence of the AADC immunoprotein in lungs as well as in the abdominal fat. We also tested the hypothesis, whether single or repeated immobilization stress can affect the AADC mRNA or immunoprotein levels in mice stellate ganglia. We revealed that single immobilization stress exposure did not affect the AADC mRNA or immunoprotein levels, while repeated immobilization stress produced significant elevation of both, AADC mRNA and immunoprotein levels in stellate ganglia. The aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase is generally not considered to be limiting in regulation of the catecholamine biosynthesis. However, our data suggest a possible participation of this enzyme in the regulation of catecholamine biosynthesis in stellate ganglia of repeatedly stressed mice.
I sure wish Grey would do his 2017 fantasy baseball rankings. Wait, I am Grey and this is those rankings! I need to sit down. Wait, I am sitting! I can't handle all of this! I'm going to put on a pair of pants and go dance in the street. Meh, let's be honest, pants are a chore. So, this is the greatest day ever! Now, only 400,000 words more until I finish my top 500 and I'll be done. Worst day ever! Damn, that excitement was fleeting. Well, not for you because you don't have to write all the rankings. You lucky son of a gun! I wish I were you… *wavy lines* Hey, why am I balding and have lost all definition in my buttocks? *wavy lines* Hmm, I'm gonna stay me. Now before we get into the top 10 for 2017 fantasy baseball (though I imagine every single one of you has skipped this intro paragraph), I'm gonna lay down some exposition. Here's where you follow us on Twitter. Here's where you follow us on Facebook. Here's our fantasy baseball player rater. Here's our fantasy baseball team name generator. Here is all of our 2017 fantasy baseball rankings. Here's the position eligibility chart for 2017 fantasy baseball. And here is a picture of my son. What a punim! You may not get all of those links in such a handy, easy-to-use format ever again this year, so make proper note. (Unless you just go to the top menu on this page that says "Rankings" and click it, but semantics, my over-the-internet friend, semantics.) Now my expositional half insists I breakdown some generalizations about these 2017 fantasy baseball rankings. The 2017 fantasy baseball rankings will be an ever-evolving mass like the blob. This fantasy baseball top 10 for 2017 list is as of right now and could potentially change with a big injury or Mike Trout quitting baseball because he's bored with being the best and wants to play competitive Mahjong. (I'm not sure yet where Trout would rank in my Mahjong Top 10.) So while it is the 2017 fantasy baseball gospel, take it with a tablet of salt. Tomorrow we will cover the rest of the top twenty for 2017 fantasy baseball, then we will go around the horn with a top 20 (more like 50) list for every position. Then for pitchers and outfielders, I'll turn the dial to 100 (more like 140). Listed with each player are my 2017 projections. Did I consult with anyone else who does projections? It would be ignorant not to, but, in the end, these are my projections. Players need 10 games at a position to get included in the positional rankings. Finally, as with each list in the 2017 fantasy baseball rankings, I will be mentioning where I see tiers start and stop. I look at tiers like this, if Jose Altuve and Paul Goldschmidt are in the same tier, it doesn't matter if one guy is ranked 2nd and one guy is ranked 5th, they're both very close. It comes down to personal preference. I would prefer the guy at number two over the guy at five, but you do you, I'll do me and let's hope we don't go blind. Anyway, here's the top 10 for 2017 fantasy baseball:

We propose that the tibial remnant of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is able to enhance the revascularization and cellular proliferation of the graft, to preserve proprioceptive function, and to be able to acquire anatomic placement of the graft without roof impingement. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that preserving the tibial remnant as much as possible as a source of reinnervation, if technically possible without causing impingement, would be of potential benefit to the patient. Our surgical technique was developed to maximize the preservation of the tibial remnant. The distally attached semitendinosus and gracilis tendons are harvested using the tendon stripper. After satisfactory placement of 2 guide pins convergently, a closed-end socket in the lateral femoral condyle is created using an adequately sized curved curette. For anatomic placement of the graft, the tibial tunnel should be positioned within the boundaries of the normal ACL tibial remnant. The reamer must be advanced very carefully to minimize injury to the residual remnant at the intra-articular margin of the tibial tunnel. Penetration should stop at the base of the stump. The folded grafts are then pulled intra-articularly through the tibial tunnel, the tibial remnant, and the femoral socket by pulling sutures under arthroscopic visualization. The ACL tibial remnant is compacted by the tendon passage. The graft is secured proximally by tying sutures in the lateral femoral condyle and distally at the tibia with double staples by a belt-buckle method. The advantages of our technique include maximal preservation of the tibial remnant, no roof impingement caused by intrasynovial anatomic placement of the graft, the simplicity of the procedure, the minimal need for hardware or special instruments, the economic benefit, and the potential prevention of tibial tunnel enlargement by preventing synovial fluid leakage.

Fibromyalgia is so difficult to diagnose that it can take years before patients understand what's making their bodies ache. When Lynn Matallana began noticing unexplained pain and fatigue in 1993 -- "pain in every part of my body, pain that felt like acid in my veins" -- it took her nearly two years and 37 doctors before she was diagnosed with fibromyalgia. In that time, the former partner in an advertising and public relations firm says, "I went from being an extremely active, high-functioning, happy individual to being confined to bed in physical and emotional agony." Once an avid skier, dancer, and yoga practitioner, Matallana, 53, of Orange, Calif., had days where she couldn't get out of bed. "It was literally a process to think of turning over and swinging my legs out," she says. "It was difficult to even go to the bathroom." She eventually had to retire from her advertising career.

In the future, or so some people think, it will become possible to upload your consciousness into a computer. Software emulations of human brains – ems, for short – will then take over the economy and world. This sort of thing happens quite a lot in science fiction, but The Age of Em is a fanatically serious attempt, by an economist and scholar at Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute, to use economic and social science to forecast in fine detail how this world (if it is even possible) will actually work. The future it portrays is very strange and, in the end, quite horrific for everyone involved.
On Wednesday, Nov. 19, at noon ET, the trade deadline for ESPN standard leagues will pass. Some leagues have custom trade deadlines, of course, but for many millions playing on ESPN.com, that'll be the day. We are even doing a two-hour trade deadline edition of "Fantasy Football Now" that morning from 10 a.m. to noon ET on ESPN2. Which is great and the threat of a deadline is always great for pushing through trades, but often times trades take more time and negotiation. In addition, we have six teams on bye this week: a crucial week for many teams trying to make a playoff push.

"Well," he barks, "it's a well-known fact, sonny Jim, that there's a secret society of the five wealthiest people in the world known as The Pentaverate, who run everything in the world, including the newspapers, and who meet triannually at a secret country mansion in Colorado known as … The Meadows." The friend humours him by asking who's in this Pentaverate. "The Queen, the Vatican, the Gettys, the Rothschilds," comes the reply, "AND Colonel Sanders before he went tits up …"

DONETSK, Ukraine—I was talking to some young black-clad pro-Russian agitators at a checkpoint they'd set up on the outskirts of this city in eastern Ukraine when a shiny black Mercedes pulled up a few yards away. Some of the men from the group walked over and stuck their heads into the car. I couldn't see who the capo was, couldn't hear what orders he was giving, but the scene was like something from a movie about the mob. Nobody wanted to say who that was in the car. Nobody wanted to repeat what he'd said.

Until a few years ago, economists of all persuasions confidently proclaimed that the Great Depression would never recur. In a way, they were right. After the financial crisis of 2008 erupted, we got the Great Recession instead. Governments managed to limit the damage by pumping huge amounts of money into the global economy and slashing interest rates to near zero. But, having cut off the downward slide of 2008-2009, they ran out of intellectual and political ammunition.

This is a variation of the Shadow Imitation Technique, designed for offensive purposes.[1] The user extends their shadow along a target's body, which, because the shadow has physical properties, the target can feel.[2] There, the shadow can be used for restraint, replacing or adding to the binding of the Shadow Imitation;[3] the closer the user is to their target, the stronger this binding becomes.[4] Like the Shadow Imitation, the Shadow–Neck Binding requires a great deal of chakra to maintain, making it weaker over extended periods of time.[5] For this reason, it is most effective when immediately used to strangle a target, hence the name.[1]

At the time when there are so many ideological clashes, rising intolerance among people of various communities, growing inequality, suppression of women, LGBT and minority rights, knowledge of Indian Constitution can free an individual from the shackles of discrimination. Over 200 city youngsters assembled at Samvidhan Square on Constitution Day , yesterday, to do their bit to raise awareness on fundamental rights and duties mentioned in the Indian Constitution for every citizen…Students from various colleges rallied from Indora chowk to Samvidhan Square to celebrate the Constitution Day on Saturday morning and they turned up with placards and pamphlets. "It is surprising to see that so many people know nothing about the Indian Constitution. When we asked some of the bystanders about their fundamental rights and duties, most of them were unable to give any answer. And this is shocking. We want to change this," said one of the youngsters, Amit Sahare.It was interesting to see so many youngsters trying to educate the citizens about their rights mentioned in the Constitution. "We distributed more than 500 notebooks and pamphlets during our rally, highlighting the fundamental rights and duties of every Indian citizen," informed a law student of Nagpur University Pranay Pillewar. Another volunteer Mayank Tembhurne added, "We distributed these notebooks which have the preamble of the Constitution especially in the beginning to a lot of school-going youngsters. It is important for them to learn about their rights and duties of as Indian citizens. This exercise is more important than reading Harry Potter in classrooms."Youngsters present on the occasion also spoke openly about extending equal rights to all minorities under Indian Constitution. "It is high time that we extend equal rights to LGBT, women, senior citizens, minorities etc. and abolish all forms of discrimination," said Ayushi Wasnik, a student of Raisoni Law School, who added, "Indian government needs to scrap article 377 from the Constitution and give equal opportunity and protection to all the people. The largest democracy of the world must hear the voice of youngsters."

NEW DELHI: A 25-year-old PhD student of Jawaharlal Nehru University has alleged that she was sexually assaulted several times inside the campus by a research scholar a few weeks ago. She alleged that he even blackmailed and threatened her to suppress the incident.This is the third such incident reported from JNU this year.The accused (whose name is being withheld as he has not been arrested yet) stays in Munirka area of south Delhi. The woman has alleged that she had given a complaint to the police earlier, but no FIR was registered even though she was taken for a medical examination.The police are probing if the allegations of non-registration of FIR are true.This time, the police registered an FIR (number 986) under sections 376 (rape) and 506 (criminal intimidation) at Vasant Kunj (north) police station late on Tuesday evening after the medical examination.The incident came to the fore on Tuesday evening after the girl dialed 100 and informed the police control room about her ordeal. Local policewomen took the girl to AIIMS ( All India Institute of Medical Sciences) after which legal formalities were initiated. NGO counsellors were roped in and her statement was recorded, police said.In her statement, the woman has alleged that she was friendly with the accused and he often visited her hostel room. However, on one occasion, he forced himself upon her. He allegedly threatened her with dire consequences and even filmed the act on his phone. He also took her to his flat in Munirka and raped her, she said.The woman has alleged that the accused said he would destroy her career if she complained to the police. Sources at the police station said that the last time the woman filed a complaint, cops called parents of the accused and reached a compromise.The accused allegedly promised to marry her. However, he continued harassing her and forced her to have physical relations again. Finally, the woman called the PCR around 2.30pm on Tuesday.The suspect absconded soon after the girl called the cops. A special team has been formed to track him and raids are being conducted at his hometown and other suspected hideouts. The cops said he is a native of Patna in Bihar.There has been a spurt in cases of crimes against women at JNU in the last two years with the number of FIRs and complaints with the police reaching around 35. The complaints with the university's disciplinary committee are not included in this number.

AMZ Dual Tone Control Expanding the BMP Tone Control This is the classic tone stack from the Big Muff distortion pedal. It is basically a pair of filters whose output is combined through the 100k mix pot. The 39k/.01 filter passes only low frequencies and attenuates the highs. The 3900pF/22k filter does the opposite; it passes highs and filters out the lows. The 100k pot blends together the signal from each filter and therefore acts as a tone control. The values shown here are from the vintage Muff pedal, but even on that classic box, the values sometimes varied slightly from those shown.

Overall, eight differences were found between the rankings of health states using the expectation of the public and the experience of patients. Given that there were six health states and five consequences, a maximum of 75 (15 per consequence) pairwise differences could have been found. Therefore, 11% of the total possible pairwise differences were found. This figure is an understatement of the extent of differences between expectations and experience because from the 15 potential pairwise differences per consequence, a total of eight pairwise comparisons involve a health state that dominates the other (i.e. in the pairwise comparison a health state has either equal or less problems in every dimension than the other health state). The eight differences therefore represent 23% of total non-dominated pairwise comparisons (8/(7*5)). The findings in this paper may be a conservative estimate of the true discrepancy between expectations and experience because the comparison was at an ordinal level and thus cardinal differences could not be investigated. Overall, this study indicates that this novel method can be used to assess whether members of the public are informed and the evidence suggests that although the participants in this study are not grossly misinformed about how health affects the six consequences, their expectations are not accurate even on an ordinal scale.

The City of Houston wants sermons from pastors engaged in the legal battle over the controversial equal rights ordinance.In a subpoena to five members of the Houston Area Pastors Council, the city is requesting a long list of documents and communications. Among them are "all speeches, presentations, or sermons" related to the Equal Rights Ordinance and "all communications with members of your congregation" regarding it and the failed petition against it.It is the city's latest move as it defends itself against a lawsuit filed in August requesting the ordinance be suspended.Pastor Hernan Castano received a subpoena and believes his sermons are protected by the First Amendment."For a city government to step into churches and ask pastors to turn in sermons, it's gone too far. This is not what America, the nation is about," he told Eyewitness News.The fight over the anti-discrimination ordinance that passed in May has included protests and petition drives. Thousands of signatures were deemed invalid, which led to the lawsuit.Some signatures were acquired at churches which make the sermons fair game, according to City Attorney Dave Feldman."If they choose to do this inside the church, choose to do this from the pulpit, then they open the door to the questions being asked," Feldman said.Monday -- the plaintiffs, former Harris County GOP Chairman Jared Woodfill and activist Steven Hotze, along with Pastor F.N. Williams Sr. and Pastor Max Miller -- filed a motion to quash the subpoenas calling them "overly-broad" and "harassment."

The chemicals in your body are like cars: to be used, they must be "parked" into the correct "garages," called receptors. Each chemical has its own shape, and a receptor which is equal and opposite. When you take a hallucinogen or other mind-altering drug, it has a shape that is similar enough to another chemical to bind to its receptors, blocking the usual chemical from attaching to anything at all. By replacing your normal neurochemicals, these drugs affect your psyche. Hallucinogens can be divided up into four categories; each different type binds to a different receptor.

Fan favorite Munenori Kawasaki  hit his first minor league home run on August 18, 2016, after nearly 800 plate appearances.  He was so excited he almost lapped John Andreoli near the end of his trot. Kawasaki is expected to be back with the Cubs once the rosters expand in September but has had a hard time cracking the 25-man roster this season.  He has appeared in only three games for the Cubs this year, including this pinch hitting assignment in the home opener:

Multidisciplinary Solving complex industrial problems requires simulation tools that span a multitude of physical phenomena and a variety of engineering disciplines. Real-world engineering problems do not separate themselves into convenient categories such as "aerodynamics", "hydrodynamics", "heat transfer" and "solid mechanics". Only multidisciplinary engineering simulation can accurately capture all of the relevant physics that influence the real-world performance of a product, and can be used to automatically drive the virtual product through a range of design configurations and operating scenarios. By minimizing the level of approximation, engineers can be confident that the predicted behavior of their design will match the real-world performance of their product.

If you live in San Francisco, chances are you already feel like you're living in a closet. But soon the city's smallest living spaces will likely be tiny enough to fit in a compact one-car garage.
So I ran across THIS story this past week about Charlotte a fashion student in London who dared, DARED to make a plus-sized collection for her graduate project. Unfortunately (but not surprisingly) she received a lot of resistance from her school about her decision to create a plus-sized fashion line and use plus-sized models. At least initially she was told that she couldn't show her collection in the University's London showcase. She was told that she would have to source all her own models for her own showcase and create all of her own pattern blocks. All this because she dared to suggest that perhaps some designs should be created for the 50 percent of the female population that can't wear "straight sizes". (Hmm, isn't "straight sizes" an interesting term in itself?)

en Español print Defining a species A species is often defined as a group of individuals that actually or potentially interbreed in nature. In this sense, a species is the biggest gene pool possible under natural conditions. For example, these happy face spiders look different, but since they can interbreed, they are considered the same species: Theridion grallator. That definition of a species might seem cut and dried, but it is not — in nature, there are lots of places where it is difficult to apply this definition. For example, many bacteria reproduce mainly asexually. The bacterium shown at right is reproducing asexually, by binary fission. The definition of a species as a group of interbreeding individuals cannot be easily applied to organisms that reproduce only or mainly asexually. Also, many plants, and some animals, form hybrids in nature. Hooded crows and carrion crows look different, and largely mate within their own groups — but in some areas, they hybridize. Should they be considered the same species or separate species? If two lineages of oak look quite different, but occasionally form hybrids with each other, should we count them as different species? There are lots of other places where the boundary of a species is blurred. It's not so surprising that these blurry places exist — after all, the idea of a species is something that we humans invented for our own convenience!
Suppose that we use the universal prior for sequence prediction, without regard for computational complexity. I think that the result is going to be really weird, and that most people don't appreciate quite how weird it will be.
Beloved:Bear your share of hardship for the gospelwith the strength that comes from God.He saved us and called us to a holy life,not according to our worksbut according to his own designand the grace bestowed on us in Christ Jesus before time began,but now made manifestthrough the appearance of our savior Christ Jesus,who destroyed death and brought life and immortalityto light through the gospel.Jesus took Peter, James, and John his brother,and led them up a high mountain by themselves.And he was transfigured before them;his face shone like the sunand his clothes became white as light.And behold, Moses and Elijah appeared to them,conversing with him.Then Peter said to Jesus in reply,"Lord, it is good that we are here.If you wish, I will make three tents here,one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."While he was still speaking, behold,a bright cloud cast a shadow over them,then from the cloud came a voice that said,"This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased;listen to him."When the disciples heard this, they fell prostrateand were very much afraid.But Jesus came and touched them, saying,"Rise, and do not be afraid."And when the disciples raised their eyes,they saw no one else but Jesus alone.As they were coming down from the mountain,Jesus charged them,"Do not tell the vision to anyoneuntil the Son of Man has been raised from the dead."

What is causing my window tint to streak and scratch and how can Tint Protector Moleskin Felt help? Every car door has weather strip seals on either side of the window glass. These weather-strips touch the window creating a seal to help keep dirt, water and noise from entering your door panel and vehicle. If you look close you will notice the outside seal has a fuzzy layer of felt applied to it. Certain models of cars only have felt on one side of the window canal of the door. Their manufacturers neglected to put this felt on the inside seal of the window. This inside window seal is made of hard plastic. With no felt applied to it like the outside seal, the hard weather strip will start to collect dirt and dust which in turn rubs against your expensive window tint causing vertical lines and scratches . Here is an example of what scratched tint looks like. This not only looks cosmetically bad, but it destroys the window film causing you to have to return to the tint shop and re-tint the car all over again. All of our anti-scratch window tint kits use our exclusive high temperature automotive grade "MoleSkin" felt. Our felt has a tremendously strong adhesive backing that can withstand more moisture and heat than any other MoleSkin felt on the market today. This super strong adhesive is critical due to the fact the inside of your door panel can reach temperatures of 200+ degrees in the summer. Other Moleskin felt not manufactured by Tint Protector lacks our special adhesive resin. It detaches from the weather strip due to excessive heat or by getting wet. The front "felt" part of Tint Protector's MoleSkin has been upgraded over generic MoleSkin to better absorb the fine particles that can get trapped in-between your hard plastic window seal and the tinted glass window. It is very important to have a thin soft absorbent felt with an adhesive that can withstand moisture and extreme heat. A felt that is too thick or has weak adhesive will detach after a short time. Tint Protector felt has many other uses as well. You can use it to soften the touch of hard plastics within a car, such as inside the door pockets and storage bins. Door pockets are usually hard plastic and don't have any sort of cushioning or soft lining. Hard plastic can damage cell phone finishes, eye glasses and i-pods et. If you line the ashtray, cup holders and center console with our MoleSkin you will have less rattles and your goods will be more protected against scratching. Our felt has 100's of uses around the house. It has such a durable adhesive, you can even use it for outside applications.

Abstract: There is an elitist master plan to destroy Europe's borders and old culture ethnically, religiously, economically for the purpose of a communist one-world government (Agenda 21). Order out of chaos is the motto of the Masonic spirits behind it. But first they want to create chaos by 1) Muslim mass immigration – by pursuing Coudenhove Kalergi´s and President Sarkozy's racial interbreeding philosophy 2) War. Furthermore, they obviously want to achieve the Biblical Endtime scenario in the Middle East (Pentacostals, Chabad Lubavitch), i.e. the Albert Pike / William Carr Plan for the 3rd World War.

A long time ago, back when the great city of Ascalon still boomed with human life, in the small town of Ashford Abbey a girl was born by the name Gabe Fall. Growing up, Gabe often went to visit Gwen, another girl that always seemed to have misplaced her flute and cape, they would play in fields filled of red iris flowers and ever so often Gabe would run off to kill a Skale or two. As they grew older Gabe would venture out further, into the catacombs or towards the Northlands, to find bigger game to kill. Alas, good times never last forever...

NEW DELHI: Even the certainty of a painful death did not deter him from doing his best to save his pet's life. Nineteen-year-old Ankit died trying to save his dog from being crushed under the wheels of a train in Sadh Nagar near Palam, southwest Delhi, on Tuesday morning.The incident took place around 6.30am. Ankit, who had just returned from his night shift at a call centre, took his pet black Labrador out for a walk near the railway tracks. While they were walking, the dog suddenly got distracted by a rodent and followed it to the tracks.Seeing a train approaching them, Ankit tried to pull the dog by its leash away from the tracks. He then got on the tracks himself to lift the dog bodily out of them. But the dog was too heavy and by then the train was too close, so Ankit switched to pulling at the leash. He was still engaged in his effort when the train hit both of them, crushing the dog and dragging him along for some distance as he did not let go.Ankit received grievous head injuries and multiple fractures. He was taken to a nearby hospital where doctors declared him dead on arrival."Our boy has passed away. What's the use of reporting the incident now? Railways have put no overbridge or boundary wall to stop people from crossing the tracks. We have lost both our son and the pet, the loss cannot be compensated," said Ran Singh, Ankit's father. Singh works for a private company.Ankit is survived by his parents and two younger siblings including a sister. Family members and locals say such tragedies have almost become a daily affair." It's a cursed stretch. This 500m length of track has seen more than five to six fatal accidents in the past one month. A few days ago, a boy who was walking on them with earphones plugged in got crushed by a train," said Sriram Singh, a local who owns a shop near the spot.Last week, two women were run over. Cattle and other animals are frequent casualties. The area is densely populated and needs a subway or an overbridge," Singh added.Police got a call around 6.35am about a young man and a dog run over by a train. " The boy's face got crushed while the dog was mowed down by the train. The boy was dragged some metres away from the spot of impact. We had a word with the family and have ruled out foul play. It is an accident. The body was sent for post mortem," said a senior police officer.The boy's family said there is no boundary wall to stop people from crossing the tracks. Locals said the 500m stretch of the track has seen five to six accidents in the past one month

The exact origins of American Indians have always been somewhat controversial. Most of us grew up with the theory that the ancestors of Native Americans migrated across the Bering Strait about 12,000 years ago. Recent archeological evidence, however, indicates that people may have lived in the Americas much longer. Most Native American tribes have origin myths that defy conventional science; as a Nez Perce park ranger told me once, "Those other tribes may have come across the Bering Strait, but we were always here."

The Luger round was used extensively by the Germans in the P08 and P38 handguns. In the U.S., the cartridge can be considered something of a sleeper hit in its early years, only achieving major popularity in the 1980's with the rise of CCW and semiautomatic pistols.

PHILLIPS It pains me to admit it, but apparently, I have passed away. Everyone told me it would happen one day but that's simply not something I wanted to hear, much less experience. Once again I didn't get things my way! That's been the story of my life all my life.And while on that subject (the story of my life)…on February 9, 1946 my parents and older sister celebrated my birth and I was introduced to all as Emily DeBrayda Fisher, the daughter of Clyde and Mary Fisher from Hazelwood. I can't believe that happened in the first half of the last century but there are records on file in the Court House which can corroborate this claim. Just two years later when another baby girl was born, I became known as the middle sister of the infamous three Fisher Girls, and the world was changed forever.As a child I walked to the old Hazelwood Elementary School where teachers like Mrs. McCracken, Mrs. Davis and Mrs. Moody planted the seed that eventually led me to becoming a teacher. I proudly started my teaching career at that same elementary school in January 1968, and from there I went on to teach young children in the neighboring states of Virginia, Georgia, as well as Florida where I retired after 25 years.So many things in my life seemed of little significance at the time they happened but then took on a greater importance as I got older. The memories I'm taking with me now are so precious and have more value than all the gold and silver in my jewelry box.Memories…where do I begin? Well, I remember Mother wearing an apron; I remember Daddy calling Square Dances; I remember my older sister pushing me off my tricycle (on the cinder driveway); I remember my younger sister sleep walking out of the house; I remember grandmother Nonnie who sewed exquisite dresses for me when I was little; I remember grandmother Mamateate wringing a chicken's neck so we could have Sunday dinner. I remember being the bride in our Tom Thumb Wedding in first grade and performing skits for the 4-H Club later in grade five. I remember cutting small rosebuds still wet with dew to wear to school on spring mornings, and I remember the smell of newly mowed grass. I remember the thrill of leading our high school band down King Street in New Orleans for Mardi Gras (I was head majorette). I remember representing Waynesville in the Miss North Carolina Pageant, and yes, I twirled my baton to the tune of ""Dixie"". It could have been no other way.I married the man of my dreams (tall, dark, and handsome) on December 16, 1967 and from that day on I was proud to be Mrs. Charlie Phillips, Grand Diva Of All Things Domestic. Our plan was to have two children, a girl and a boy. Inexplicably we were successful in doing exactly that when we were blessed with our daughter Bonnie and then later our son Scott. Seeing these two grow into who they were supposed to be brought a wonderful sense of meaning to our lives.This might be a good time to mend fences.I apologize for making sweet Bonnie wear No Frills jeans when she was little and for ""red-shirting"" Scott in kindergarten. Apparently each of these things was humiliating to them but both were able to rise above their shame and become very successful adults. I'd also like to apologize to Mary Ann for tearing up her paper dolls and to Betsy for dating a guy she had a crush on.Just when I thought I was too old to fall in love again, I became a grandmother, and my five grand-angels stole not only my heart, but also spent most of my money.Sydney Elizabeth, Jacob McKay, and Emma Grace (all Uprights) have enriched my life more than words can say. Sydney's ""one more, no more"" when she asked for a cookie; Jake saying he was ""sick as a cat"" when I'd said that someone else was sick as a dog; and Emma cutting her beautiful long hair and then proceeding to shave off one of her eyebrows…Yes, these are a few of my favorite things. They're treasures that are irreplaceable and will go with me wherever my journey takes me.I've always maintained that my greatest treasures call me Nana. That's not exactly true. You see, the youngest of my grand-angels, William Fisher Phillips and Charlie Jackson Phillips call me ""Nana Banana"". (Thank you Chris and Scott for having such spunky children.) These two are also apt to insist that I ""get their hiney"" whenever I visit, and since I'm quite skilled in that area , I've always been able to oblige. (I actually hold the World's Record for ""Hiney Getting,"" a title that I wear with pride.)Speaking of titles…I've held a few in my day. I've been a devoted daughter
There will likely come a day when humanity itself has shuffled off the mortal coil, leaving behind nothing but data to list our accomplishments. However, most of the data storage methods we currently have only last a few decades if we're lucky. The accumulated history of mankind surely deserves more longevity than that, doesn't it? A team of Dutch and German researchers have developed a technology that could hold readable data for up to 1 billion years. That ought to give someone a chance to find it and learn how great we were.
Have you ever wonder why we live? What's the purpose of our existence?

When the National Security Agency discovers a new vulnerability that looks like it might be of use in penetrating target networks, the agency considers a number of factors, including how popular the affected software is and where it's typically deployed, before deciding whether to share the new bug. The agency shares most of the bugs it finds, NSA Director Mike Rogers said, but not all of them.

There is one undeniable truth about the Dwyane Wade signing for the Chicago Bulls: the people who made it happen couldn't be more satisfied with themselves for it. A Jerry Reinsdorf team has no use for the cyclical nature of competitiveness in pro sports, where "rebuild" is a dirty word that tapers the bottom line and a race to the middle is always preferable to bottoming out.
The New Black is a documentary that tells the story of how the African-American community is grappling with the gay rights issue in light of the recent gay marriage movement and the fight over civil rights. The film documents activists, families and clergy on both sides of the campaign to legalize gay marriage and examines homophobia in the black community's institutional pillar-the black church and reveals the Christian right wing's strategy of exploiting this phenomenon in order to pursue an anti-gay political agenda. The New Black takes viewers into the pews and onto the streets and provides a seat at the kitchen table as it tells the story of the historic fight to win marriage equality in Maryland and charts the evolution of this divisive issue within the black community.

After the successful disruption of Milo's talk at Berkeley, Trump memorably took to twitter to complain about "professional anarchists" and "paid protesters." But Trump and his supporters aren't the only ones who've been peddling conspiracy theories about antifa: the World Socialist Web Site (WSWS) recently published a pair of hit pieces aiming to spread the myth that "significant numbers of the hooded anarchists who rioted in Berkeley were police agents or informants."
It was a difficult end to 2016, losing the title at the final round to his team mate - despite employing some tactics that did not go down too well at Mercedes. But everyone knows that Lewis Hamilton is about far more than just the racing. After an off-season enjoying some of the other highs that life has to offer, the three-time world champion is back - freshly pierced and inked, and ready to take on the challenge that is 2017… Q: Lewis, the bookmakers have you as the runaway favourite to win this year's championship. How do you see it? Lewis Hamilton: Ah, is that so? I didn't know that. That's nice to hear. Well, I am fitter, I am working harder than ever before and I am super focused and driven after last year - when I also worked hard through the year but didn't get the result I wanted. So I want change and that is what the team and I are working so hard to achieve. I am not really sure, but I don't think that any team has ever won championships across rules changes - and that is the big goal for us. We want to stay up front - but it will be a very interesting season for us, and for the fans.

Ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to the US, the Trump administration said on Wednesday it will spend $7.5 million to help advance India's power grid, as part of the two countries' commitments to ensuring access to affordable and reliable energy.The Ministry of Science and Technology and industry will match the commitment of US' Department of Energy, bringing the total commitment to $30 million, officials here said."This new consortium demonstrates the US and Indian commitments to ensuring access to affordable and reliable energy in both countries," Energy Secretary Rick Perry said."We know that continued grid innovation will promote economic growth and energy security in the United States and India," he said.The initiative, part of America's commitment to fostering the reliable, resilient and secure delivery of electricity, was needed for the strong US national security, economic growth and global leadership, as well as furthering Department of Energy (DOE)'s collaboration with India under the US-India Partnership to Advance Clean Energy (PACE), officials said.The US-India collaboration for smart distribution system with storage (UI-ASSIST) was selected as the new consortia for Smart Grid and Energy Storage under the US-India Joint Clean Energy Research and Development Center (JCERDC), the DOE said in a statement.To help pave the way to a more advanced distribution grid that will allow greater use of distributed energy resources such as microgrids and energy storage, the new consortia will bring together experts from academia, DOE's national laboratories and industry, it said.Together with their counterparts in India, the center will conduct research and deploy new smart grid and energy storage technologies that will modernise the grids of both the nations to make them "smarter", while increasing resilience and reliability, the DOE said.Through JCERDC, the US' world class installations and national laboratories will contribute their expertise and capabilities as India expands energy access to its remote areas, improves its grid reliability and resilience, and strengthens its energy security.The US participants will gain insight from India's grid modernisation efforts a potential export market for US equipment worth billions of dollars and promote researcher access to India's grid operational experience, it said.UI-ASSIST's US team, led by Washington State University, is comprised of MIT, Texas A&M University, University of Hawaii, Idaho National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Snohomish County (WA) Public Utility District, Avista, Burns and McDonnell, ETAP Operation Technology, ALSTOM Grid/GE Grid Solutions, Clean Energy Storage, ABB, Philadelphia Industrial Development Corporation, and the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA).The Indian team, led by the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, includes partners from IIIT Delhi, IIT Madras, IIT Roorkee, IIT Bhubaneshwar and The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) New Delhi.

Musk compared it to a piece of sculpture that would hang on your wall, and in addition to the base model pictured above, it comes in an assortment of different colors.
One stereotype that all rock and metal bands face is that they're doing it all for the chicks. While this may not be 100% true, hot babes are one of the many perks available in the life of a successful musician. No matter how big the ego of a rockstar or how many groupies they've bagged, when they meet the right woman, these musicians are brought to their knees.

After nearly every game by the US national team, the Guardian runs an analysis on what we learned from them. Presumably the well paid coaching team headed by Jürgen Klinsmann performs a similar exercise – though at times since the World Cup it's been hard to see those insights adding up into any sort of cumulative institutional knowledge. Instead we get line-up changes, formation switches, reversions, and general emphasis on "the process" rather than the results. Each game feels like a fresh hot take on what is to be done – team history written as a sequence of blog posts.

Actually considering their performances, they were not in their "golden opportunity" otherwise they'd perform better. You need the inexperienced player to build his confidence around teammates and opponents. Give him the position he is comfortable with and he will perform better than if they were put into some throwaway role. If that doesn't work then don't keep them.

Some would say we learn everything from nature, as we are a part of nature. However, as human beings over the millennia, we have categorised ourselves as masters of nature and outside of it, wherever possible. The Judaeo-Christian religions sought to lift mankind above all other animals through its connection with a supernatural entity who lived everywhere and in heaven. The religious rules taught us that all the plants and animals were here for our purposes. This ethos has not served the planet well over the long term, with mass degradation and extinction of environment and species resulting. What we can learn from nature is now more paramount than ever.

Being The Glute Guy's girlfriend has its drawbacks. My fiancee Diana constantly finds herself serving as a guinea pig when I want to test out a new hypothesis. In September of 2013, I shared with you The Hip Thrust Only Experiment, where I altered Diana's training from a routine focused on squats and deadlifts to a routine focused on hip thrusts. The results? No weight change (which was to be expected since her diet didn't change), no change in hip or thigh measurements (I predicted greater hip size and lesser thigh size, but it was only a 6-week experiment and she had been doing hip thrusts during her powerlifting training), and a reduction in waist circumference (presumably due to less erector spinae activation). This was a cool experiment, since it showed that it is indeed possible to maintain glute size if one drops out squats and deadlifts and keeps hammering hip thrusts.

Legislation has been introduced in Congress to defund and overturn a controversial Obama administration decree from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to transform and "diversify" American neighborhoods under the direction of Big Brother. The new bill would also reverse the attempted unconstitutional usurpation of power over local zoning decisions by the federal government and the unelected regional authorities charged with managing the transformation. And the measure would end a "geospatial database" mandated under the scheme to track the racial and income composition of each area, a key element of the scheme to redistribute people based on their melanin content and earnings.

Among them are Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed, Tom Waits, and Anthony Newley.
That awful King Dedede is at it again—he's stolen all the food in Dream Land! It's up to Kirby to get it back…and ultimately save Pop Star from being taken over. In what may be the most diverse adventure yet for the round, pink hero, he journeys through six main games and two minigames, finishing with the ultimate showdown in The Arena. Each game offers its own story and variation of platforming action, as well as unique environments and an assortment of enemies. Speaking of which, swallowing an enemy allows Kirby to copy the abilities of that enemy, granting him the power to perform special attacks and giving him a new hat to don. Adding a strategic twist, Kirby can now give up an acquired ability and use it to instead turn an enemy into a helper. The helper will follow Kirby around and automatically fight as his ally—or offer a second player the chance to join in the game by controlling it. There's never a dull moment as Kirby dashes, flies, and swallows enemies in his battle against King Dedede, Dyna Blade, Meta Knight, and more!

SOMETIMES a single word can capture a moment in politics. In 2008 it was Hope that carried Barack Obama to the White House. A bleaker noun seems to hold voters in its power just now: Fight. The country's combative mood helps to explain the huge crowds, some exceeding 28,000 people, that have been turning out to cheer Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a pugnacious underdog in the contest for the next Democratic presidential nomination. Mr Sanders has risen in the polls all summer, closing fast on the front-runner, Hillary Clinton and even overtaking her in one August survey of New Hampshire voters.

New Guinea singing dog or New Guinea Highland dog gets its name from a unique vocalization. It's more famous for being exceedingly rare. They were photographed in 1989 and 2012, but were suspected to be extinct. That was until last week. Researchers confirmed the existence of a population, hidden in a remote area, including over 100 photos and DNA analysis of the most ancient and primitive canids in existence. No sooner did NatGeo Japan post their coverage than Kemono Friends designer (and Sgt. Frog author) Mine Yoshizaki posted his take on the doggie.

Pollution can seem like a vague, general problem, but sometimes it is specific and personal. People with asthma living in some major cities know to keep tabs on the ozone report in the weather forecast, for example. And frequent anglers should be keenly aware of how much of their catch they put on the dinner table because of mercury contamination in fish. Mercury is a problem for marine fish, as well—particularly the ever-popular tuna.

One of the conditions for Aristide's return in 1994 was that he was willing to drop the tariff on imported rice - Haiti had a very active peasant agriculture - and as a result you had all this rice flooding into Haiti, being sold at a price that undercut local farmers. They lost the ability to sell their own agriculture, and you have people flooding into the cities for jobs that don't exist, living in substandard housing that is not safe. So when you have the earthquake in 2010, you have tens of thousands of people dying, one of the reasons those people died is those economic policies from the US.

Myanmar is one of the most Buddhist nations in the world, with around 48 million practicing citizens. It is also one of Southeast Asia's largest narcotics producers, known for funnelling large quantities of opium, cannabis, and methamphetamine to neighbouring countries. So it stands to reason that religion and drug trafficking come together every now and then—as they did when police discovered a stash of more than four million methamphetamine pills hidden within the otherwise inconspicuous Shwe Baho monastery on Monday.
She thought they looked familiar, Noa Osheroff did, when she stopped in for a drink at Early Mercy, a newish bar on King St. W. In town from New York for the Hot Docs Film Festival in May, she knew a quick way to confirm. After an iPhone snapshot-and-send to her brother, Yair Osheroff, her guess seemed a good one: that the stylized portraits of world leaders lining the wall of the bar above the lengthy banquette were unauthorized copies of "Hipstory," a series of works by Amit Shimoni, an Israeli artist Yair represented.

Van Gundy also owns a career 41-40 (.506) record in the postseason.

Back in May it was reported that every rape assault in the city of Oslo in the last five years had been committed by a person with a "non-Western" background – a Norwegian euphemism for Muslim. Now it turns out that there have already been twice as many rape assaults in Oslo so far this year as there were in all of 2010. At least one member of Parliament, André Oktay Dahl of the Conservative Party, calls the situation "critical" and is brave enough to acknowledge that many of the perpetrators come from cultures "with a reprehensible attitude toward women."

Until very recently, CBD has lived in the shadow of its infamous cannabinoid cousin, THC, which is widely known as the high-inducing compound in Marijuana. However, extensive research is now being conducted on CBD and its medical potential, which has opened the doors for antipsychotic, anticancer and antiinflammatory treatment options among MANY others. One after another, scientists are publishing studies that prove CBD is the most dynamic and useful of the cannabinoids as far as promotion of proper function of the systems of the body is concerned.

There is a reason the National Alliance on Mental Illness calls its outreach program "Ending the Silence".

After an invocation and brief introductions, lawmakers immediately recessed. Vice Speaker John Mizuno indicated Representatives would reconvene at 11 a.m., but nearly an hour has come and gone since then with no indication of when legislators will return to the floor. Republican Minority caucus member, Representative Bob McDermott, who is a staunch opponent of SB 1, says the delay is a result of in-fighting between Democratic Majority caucus members. McDermott says a few Representatives reportedly want a roll-call vote on the floor for a proposal to introduce a Constitutional Amendment to let the people vote on same-sex marriage, but not everyone agrees.

Engine rod knock is often caused by low oil levels. Your engine requires oil to lubricate moving parts, as well as cooling. Without sufficient oil levels in the engine, there is bound to be excessive heat as well as wearing of parts, and this will lead to a rod knock. If your car gets an engine rod knock, you will most probably need to have the lower half of your engine replaced if not the whole engine, depending on the extent of damage. It will normally affect your pistons, crank shaft and rods. Replacements of these parts will cost you quite a good amount of money and time, as your car will have to be in the garage for a while after experiencing an engine rod knock.

For the past twenty-one years, L. Brooks Patterson has governed Oakland County, a large, affluent suburb of Detroit. Oakland County embodies fiscal success as much as Detroit does financial ruin, and Patterson, the county executive, tends to behave as though his chief job in life were to never let anyone forget it. One week in September, he gave me an extended tour of his empire, in a chauffeured minivan. Near the end of the first day, we headed toward Lake St. Clair, at the mouth of the Detroit River, for a party on a yacht. Patterson sat in the front passenger seat. Over his shoulder, he said, "Anytime I talk about Detroit, it will not be positive. Therefore, I'm called a Detroit basher. The truth hurts, you know? Tough shit." The landscape slid past, a jumbled time line of American suburban innovation: big-box districts, fuel megacenters, shopping malls, restaurants with the interior acreage of a factory. "I love sprawl," Patterson once declared. "I need it. I promote it. Oakland County can't get enough of it." This credo is now memorialized on Oakland County's Web site. Patterson told me, "I used to say to my kids, 'First of all, there's no reason for you to go to Detroit. We've got restaurants out here.' They don't even have movie theatres in Detroit—not one." He went on, "I can't imagine finding something in Detroit that we don't have in spades here. Except for live sports. We don't have baseball, football. For that, fine—get in and get out. But park right next to the venue—spend the extra twenty or thirty bucks. And, before you go to Detroit, you get your gas out here. You do not, do not, __under any circumstances, stop in Detroit at a gas station! That's just a call for a carjacking." "That's true," his driver, a retired cop named Tim, muttered. "You're not in Kansas anymore." Patterson just turned seventy-five. Pink-cheeked and silver-haired, he wears rimless eyeglasses and dark suits. His distinctive, slightly slurred baritone is known throughout southeastern Michigan. His sentences often start with "Ah my gad!" Before becoming the county executive, Patterson, a Republican, served for sixteen years as the county prosecutor. He banned plea bargains to the extent that, as he tells it, criminals knew to avoid Oakland County, because the chief law-enforcement officer was a "crazy motherfucker" who did not make deals. He went after strip clubs and porn shops so zealously that a judge ordered him to stop "Eliot Ness-style raids." His government career has spanned the terms of seven Detroit mayors; the eighth, Mike Duggan, was inaugurated on January 1st. Patterson is known for being a shrewd tactician who has introduced creative initiatives to keep Oakland County solvent. Oakland is one of only several dozen counties in the U.S. that Standard & Poor's has given a triple-A bond rating, the highest possible credit score; Patterson maintained the distinction even during the recession, and even as Detroit's recent collapse into bankruptcy has threatened to destabilize the regional economy. In 2013, an S. & P. analyst said that, if counties were color-coded, Oakland would be platinum. Since the 2008 Wall Street crash, Oakland County has struggled with a sluggishly rebounding housing market and a high unemployment rate, but its budget is balanced through 2017 and, as Detroit contends with eighteen billion dollars in debt, Oakland has a surplus of more than two hundred million dollars. In October, Governing, a nonpartisan magazine in Washington, D.C., named Patterson one of nine public officials of the year, citing his pioneering use of a three-year rolling budget, which allows the county to plan ahead for problems rather than be forced to triage them in a crisis. One of the magazine's editors told the Detroit Free Press that Patterson represents the kind of farsighted fiscal management that "should be a model for counties and cities and states everywhere." Still, he is best known for his big mouth. When a black Detroit city councilwoman alleged racism during a business dispute, Patterson publicly declared that he'd "rather own a 1947 Buick than own" her. After accusing Detroit of trying to save itself by poaching Oakland County companies, he said, "I don't see how moving furniture around on the deck of the Titanic helps this region grow." In 2012, Robert Ficano, the executive of Wayne County, which includes Detroit, became the subject of a federal investigation; when Patterson was asked what advice he'd give Ficano, he joked, "Go in the garage, pull the door down, leave the engine running." Patterson once compared road reforms to rape. He marked the death of Coleman Young—Detroit's first black mayor and a former nem

In the last couple of years, at least 72 more parklets have materialized worldwide in places like Philadelphia, New Orleans, Seattle, Chicago, Mexico City and Auckland, New Zealand. (In cities with cold weather, sponsors of parklets are typically required to remove them in winter.) This year, the Los Angeles metro area will welcome four of them, sponsored by local business improvement districts and chambers of commerce. In San Francisco, parklets are open to the public, but they're typically commissioned by small businesses hoping to attract customers, brighten streetscapes and create gathering spaces.

It has been nearly a half-century—49 years Friday—since three gunmen rushed Malcolm X at the Audubon Ballroom in Harlem and killed him. The battle over his legacy, begun before his body was buried and fed with the posthumous release of his Autobiography several months later, rages still. Depending on one's viewpoint, he is a true hero or a tragically flawed one; a race-baiter; an inspiration; and even the subject of lurid conspiracy theories. Perhaps more than anything, he's rolled out as a foil to Martin Luther King—the more aggressive, militant yang to King's yin.
A model dressed as a Playboy bunny poses with the first Hebrew language edition of the popular men's magazine in Tel Aviv, Israel, Tuesday, March 5, 2013. Israelis can now read Playboy "for the articles." A U.S. emigre, Daniel Pomerantz, on Tuesday launched the first Hebrew language edition of the popular men's magazine. Playboy has been widely available in Israel for years, but this marks the first local edition of the magazine. It features Israeli models and articles by Israeli writers. It's not clear how well the magazine will be received in the Holy Land, where religious sensitivities simmer under the surface and observant Jews and Muslims live by strict modesty rules. Adult magazines and videos are freely available, but not with local models and not in Hebrew. Playboy was launched in 1953 with the iconic Marilyn Monroe centerfold. It peaked in popularity in the 1970's. Circulation has declined since the rise of adult Internet sites. (AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)

[JURIST] The US Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit [official website] on Friday granted a stay [opinion] on the preliminary injunction that had halted Michigan's ban on taking selfies [Mich. Comp. Laws § 168.738(2), text] with completed voting ballots. In granting the stay, this places the ban back into effect. The district court opinion [JURIST report] below had held such a ban was a violation of First Amendment free speech [text]. Michigan has banned exposing marked ballots to others since 1891, making plaintiff Joel Crookston's 2012 "ballot selfie" technically illegal. Crookston filed suit to permit such pictures, an issue the appeals court elected to table until after the coming presidential election. In the opinion, Judge Jeffrey Sutton acknowledged that Cookston raised important First Amendment question, but stated that "timing is everything[, and] we will not accept his invitation to suddenly alter Michigan's venerable voting protocols, especially when he could have filed this lawsuit long ago."

Dear Donald Trump,I hope your campaign to be the next president of the United States will soon wrap up and you can return to your towers.Someone recently asked me if I was Muslim as I stood in line at an airport coffee shop, and I thought of you. I am not Muslim, but you see, I am brown, so I am often asked questions like that. It is not something a white person, especially a white man, is asked, so you probably don't know what it is like to be asked that question. That question that makes you immediately into the other, the outsider, the person who does not belong, all suggested in just that one question. "I am American" I like to reply sometimes, but for some people like you that's not a good enough answer.I have put together some of the things you have said about Muslims. Like this, in November, 2015: "I saw clips, and so did many other people - and many people saw it in person. I've had hundreds of phone calls to the Trump organization saying, 'We saw it. There was dancing in the streets." This is what you claimed happened after September 11 , even though it has been proved blatantly false. Here is what you said after the attacks in San Bernardino in December, 2015, "We're going to be so vigilant. We're going to be so careful. We're going to be so tough and so mean and so nasty... I think there can be profiling... You have people that have to be tracked. If they're Muslims, they're Muslims."We are going to be so mean and nasty? Mr. Trump, you are a little behind on that one. We people of color in America have experiences of meanness and nastiness in some form or the other long before you suggested it. The Sikh man killed because he was suspected of being Muslim? The grandfather out for a walk assaulted by the police because he was brown, or was it because he did not speak English? I will not even go into the shooting and killing of young black men, but surely you know of them? In my dozen or so years in America, I have been told to go home, I have been asked to repeat myself because my spoken English was not comprehensible, I have been asked to slow down because I speak too fast in a "foreign" accent. Me, I had to learn to be silent because speaking up is scary when you are repeatedly treated as the "other", the outsider. It can be dangerous but now I have to speak up because what you are saying to me is a direct threat to my life in America.I am not a political commentator and you are used to being the winner, the one who gets to send people home, the one who gets to call people "loser", the one who gets to point the finger at the person who is front of you and tell them that they can and should leave. But I think you underestimate the strength of the "others" in this country and you cannot ask us to leave, you cannot call us the loser. This is not your show. We, the others, who are as American as you - actually perhaps even more, because we the others abide by the founding principles this country were built upon, the principles of liberty and equality - we have a voice and we are coming together.So, listen Mr. Trump. We are a country of immigrants, we are all Americans and this is our country and no one, no one shall spread fear like disease among us because we know like no one else how fear and anger and repression and bigotry and racism and hatred can kill the soul of a person before it kills the body and we, like no one else, can spread the word that we are all equal Americans. We will not let your racist statements frighten us into believing that the "other" is a threat because of their difference in color or religion or sexual preference.Listen Mr. Trump, Je suis Charlie Hebdo, black lives matter and I, I am also Muslim.(Chandra Ganguly is a writer/blogger living in Palo Alto, California.

At least two (white) people responded angrily to me/acted very offended that I had the nerve to point out that we sing mostly white music.
US scientist Charles Zimmerman determined that a helicopter rotor could work just as well if put below a vehicle as above it. After a scary-looking device with uncovered blades called the De Lackner Aerocycle was flown, the Hiller Company built the VZ-1 Pawnee. The Pawnee worked on the basis of so-called 'kinesthetic control'. In other words, the vehicle's direction and speed was controlled by the pilot shifting his body. It was thought that any soldier could learn this instinctive form of control. Second and third versions, each with a larger, deeper rotor duct were built. The third was so large that kinesthetic control was ineffective and it had a seat and conventional helicopter controls. These designs flew well enough, but the army judged them to be too small, slow and of limited usefulness and practicality for combat service. Jim Winchester "The World's Worst Aircraft", 2005 In late 1953 the U.S. Navy's Office of Naval Research (ONR), acting as technical direction agent for the Army, awarded Hiller Helicopters a contract for the development of a twin-engined ducted fan VTOL research vehicle of the 'flying platform' type. The craft was intended to explore both the practicality of the ducted fan as a propulsion unit for V/STOL aircraft and the potential military value of the flying platform as a tactical reconnaissance and transport vehicle. The first prototype of the Hiller machine was completed in September 1954 and given the interim, non-standard Navy designation YHO-1E. The vehicle made its first non-tethered flight in February 1955, and shortly thereafter was redesignated VZ-1. The first VZ-1 prototype bore a superficial resemblance to the contemporary De Lackner HZ-1 and, like that machine, carried its pilot and twin 40hp engines on a small circular platform directly above two contra-rotating airscrews. Unlike those of the HZ-1, however, the Hiller machine's fans were mounted inside a five-foot diameter duct, beneath which were fitted eight moveable vanes used to improve the craft's lateral stability. The VZ-1's pilot stood upright just behind the narrow control pedestal, to which he was secured by safety belts, and held onto a set of bicycle-like handlebars fitted with a simple twist throttle and a propeller torque control. The flying platform was kinesthetically controlled; to initiate directional movement the pilot would simply lean in the desired direction and alter the craft's altitude by increasing or decreasing engine power. The Army was favorably impressed by the VZ-1's performance during the initial ONR-managed flight test programme, and in November 1956 ordered a single modified example for service testing and operational evaluation. This second VZ-1 differed from the first example in having a third 40hp engine, an eight-foot diameter duct without lower control vanes, and a simplified control pedestal. The second Pawnee (serial 56-6944) made its maiden flight in 1958, and the following year was joined in Army service by a third, further modified example. This third VZ-1 (serial 56-6945) had a duct of greatly increased height, a single circular landing skid instead of the three- and four-point wheeled landing gear of the earlier craft, conventional helicopter-type flight controls, and a seat for the pilot. The VZ-1s provided a wealth of valuable information about VTOL flight in general and the value of the ducted fan in particular, but ultimately proved to be too ungainly, too heavy, too slow, and too mechanically delicate to be of any real value on the battlefield. Further development of the type was therefore suspended and all three types had been withdrawn from service by 1963. S.Harding "U.S.Army Aircraft since 1947", 1990

The banana is the world's most popular fruit crop, with over 100m metric tons produced annually in over 130 tropical and subtropical countries. Edible bananas are the result of a genetic accident in nature that created the seedless fruit we enjoy today. Virtually all the bananas sold across the western world belong to the so-called Cavendish subgroup of the species and are genetically nearly identical. These bananas are sterile and dependent on propagation via cloning, either by using suckers and cuttings taken from the underground stem or through modern tissue culture.

"You know what, given the context of this particular debate and everything, I think maybe it's best to avoid using the words 'pink' or 'stink' at all, and certainly never in the same sentence," longtime Biden adviser Mike Donilon was overheard telling the 69-year-old politician during debate preparations this week, also reminding him to avoid any mention of "muffs," "tang," "cooze" and to definitely not do "the shocker" hand gesture while walking to the podium. "This is a very important night for us, Joe, and if you could try to stay on message as much as possible that would be, you know, ideal. Also, don't do that thing where you smell your finger." At press time, sources said Biden had assured Donilon he would do his best, but couldn't guarantee he wouldn't "pop wood" at some point during the debate.

You are used to seeing Solar Wrath as a cone of flame that burns away everything in its path. What is unleashed now through the second ring is a beam of red-orange light. In the dark of night, this would light up the sky, but in this early afternoon it is far less distinctive. The focused bolt of mana roars through the air for several seconds before thinning and fading out. Inordinately pleased with yourself, you call up Samantha again. «Well? Did we get them?»

Chase Dellwo, 26, and his brother Shane, 30, were bow-hunting elk in windy conditions with snow and rain northwest of Choteau, Montana on Saturday. The two split up to drive an elk they were tracking up to a ridge. Chase was hot on the elk's heels and didn't notice the sleeping and presumed 350-400-pound grizzly bear.

I've often wondered what would happen if a group of umpires came together to make a call that was so obviously wrong, so over-the-top blatantly inaccurate as to be completely nonsensical. Like, what if a pitcher threw a pitch, and the batter grounded out, and the umpires signaled for an automatic double? Obviously, the defensive team's manager would get ejected, and a bunch of other guys would probably get ejected too, but, then what? If the umpires all agree that the batter doubled, who steps in to prevent the double? Does the defensive team leave the field in protest? Are they then given a forfeit? Does the commissioner get involved? The commissioner would have to get involved. But this is a thought experiment — of course, something like this would never happen.
Simón Bolívar was a South American soldier who was instrumental in the continent's revolutions against the Spanish empire. Born into wealth, Bolívar was sent to Spain for his education, soon deciding to immerse himself in the political sphere in Europe. After France invaded Spain in 1808, he became involved in the resistance movement and played a key role in the Spanish American fight for independence. In 1825, the "Republic of Bolivia" was created in honor of the inspirational leader, hailed by many as El Libertador (The Liberator). He died on December 17, 1830 in Colombia.

In an earlier post, I relayed her allegation that after realizing that it was Mase who hit her car (even though he allegedly would not roll down his window or get out of the car), the woman told local radio jock Ryan Cameron that nearby trannies broke their necks to tell her that Mase had been cruising for a "date" with one of them.

— In Arizona, a request to add a lifetime benefit cap and a work requirement to Medicaid. This is part of a nationwide conservative crusade that overlooks that the vast majority of Medicaid enrollees already are employed or are ill, disabled, going to school, or caring for family members at home. It's an ideologically punitive rather than practical policy. Kentucky's GOP Gov. Matt Bevin, a sworn enemy of the Affordable Care Act even though its implementation under his Democratic predecessor, Steve Beshear, was one of the most successful in the nation, also wants to add a work requirement to the ACA's Medicaid expansion.
Cancer patients are at much greater risk of bankruptcy than people without cancer, according to a large new study.

Richardson has played a fair amount outside linebacker and even a little inside linebacker this season due to the Jets' plethora of talent along their defensive line. But last week against the Ravens, Richardson returned to his natural position of 3-4 defensive end — or "three-technique," in his words — and had a big game, picking up a sack, two quarterback hits and three tackles for loss in the win. It was a reminder of how dangerous Richardson can be in that spot.
It is well known that when lactating livestock eat avocado (Persea americana) leaves they may develop non‐infectious mastitis and agalactia. This is associated with extensive coagulative necrosis of the secretory acinar epithelium and interstitial oedema, congestion, and haemorrhage. Similar lesions have been produced in mammary glands of lactating mice fed a diet containing a small percentage of freeze‐dried avocado leaf. Tests using these animals have been used to isolate the active principle, termed persin, from avocado leaves. The purified persin was examined using IR, NMR, and UV spectroscopy and mass spectrometry, and identified as (Z,Z)‐1‐(acetyloxy)‐2‐hydroxy‐12,15‐heneicosadien‐4‐one. Persin has previously been isolated from avocado leaves and shown to have antifungal properties and to be toxic to silkworms. Our tests have shown that persin at the dose rate of 60‐100 mg/kg has the same effect on mammary glands in lactating mice as leaves from avocado. Enantioselective syntheses of the R and the S isomers of persin and related derivatives were carried out. These compounds were tested for activity required to induce widespread lactating mammary gland necrosis in mice, and only the R isomer was found active. At doses of persin above 100 mg/kg necrosis of myocardial fibres may occur and hydrothorax may be present in severely affected animals. The mechanism of action of persin on both the mammary gland and the myocardium remain to be resolved. © 1995 Wiley‐Liss, inc.

Katsuji Tanabe is chef-partner of Los Angeles' MexiKosher restaurant, or as he puts it, "a great little Mexican restaurant that happens to be kosher." He's also a contestant on this coming season of Bravo's "Top Chef" and has recently partnered with the Jewish Big Brothers & Big Sisters of Los Angeles as a mentor to teach kids about eating and cooking healthfully. Tanabe grew up in Mexico (his father's Japanese, and his mother's Mexican), where he created his first meal at the age of 6. It was paella. After moving to Los Angeles at 18, he enrolled in culinary school but left to cook in kitchens such as Bastide and Mastro's Steakhouse and later kosher steakhouse Shilo's. His creative kosher cooking led him to open MexiKosher, the first Kosher Mexican restaurant in Los Angeles; it's Mexican cooking without the pork, shellfish or dairy. The "carnitas," for example, is made from brisket braised in duck fat, and the crema is soy-based. There are also 14 salsas on the menu, numbered according to their spice levels.

I love making baby quilts for my friends when they are expecting a new arrival, but sometimes there is just not enough time. I have so many projects that are unfinished, so many ideas for crafts I could do to decorate my new house, not to mention chasing my son and dog around most of the day, that making a quilt sometimes just isn't in the cards, but I still want to make something special. There is something about receiving a homemade gift that is different. You can feel the time and love that went into it. And, I want my friends to know that I cherish them enough to make them something from my heart.

A long time in the making as well as a complete surprise on its arrival, the self-titled debut from FFS -- the collaboration between Franz Ferdinand and Sparks -- is the work of two great, and distinctive, acts at the top of their game. In fact, FFS works so well because these groups aren't carbon copies of each other. Over the years, Sparks brainy shape-shifting has touched on glam and new wave, two of the styles that were most influential on Franz Ferdinand's suave dance-rock, but that's just the tip of their musical iceberg. What the bands do share -- jaunty wit and a flair for indelible choruses -- gives FFS plenty of fertile common ground. These songs are inspired, even-handed combinations of all of their strengths, whether Ron and Russell Mael lend a dash of weirdness to Franz Ferdinand's spiky hooks, as on "Call Girl," or the Glaswegian outfit adds some heft to Sparks' flights of fancy on the satirical "Police Encounters" or the hyperactive "So Desu Ne." FFS' strongest moments bring passion to its abundant cleverness. Somewhat perversely and sometimes poignantly, the supergroup is at its best when singing about different kinds of solitude. "Piss Off," the first song Sparks sent Franz Ferdinand back in 2004 after the release of their debut album, is a cheerfully antisocial anthem for those who'd rather be alone. "Collaborations Don't Work"'s self-referential duet turns into a duel, with Alex Kapranos and Russell Mael trading barbs like "I don't need your navel gazing/I don't like your way of phrasing." However, the best showcase for their vocals is the brilliant opening track "Johnny Delusional." At once grandiose and self-deprecating, it's a vivid portrait of unrequited love that combines Kapranos' smooth baritone and Mael's anxious counter tenor like a juxtaposition of fantasy and reality. Similarly, FFS boasts so much personality that character sketches like "Dictator's Son," which tells the story of a despot's offspring who is more into creature comforts than tyranny, also rank among the standouts. A near-perfect blend of Sparks and Franz Ferdinand's skills, FFS is a collaboration that works very well and offers just about everything a fan of either band could want.

Memantine and neramexane are noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists which have been investigated for their promising effects in aiding memory in people with dementia. Memantine is approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and neramexane is currently under development for this indication. Therefore, the present study provided a comparative assessment of the effects of equimolar doses of memantine and neramexane on spatial (hippocampus-dependent) memory. Adult male rats were given only 3 training trials to learn the location of a hidden platform in a water maze. In control (vehicle-injected) rats, this minimal amount of training produced intact short-term (15 min), but poor long-term (24 h), memory. Pre-training administration of memantine or neramexane produced a dose-dependent enhancement of long-term memory. Pharmacokinetic experiments with equimolar doses of both agents indicated that lower plasma levels of neramexane were more effective than memantine at enhancing memory. The effective doses of both agents in the current study produced plasma levels (and extrapolated brain CSF levels) within a range of activity at NMDA receptors and plasma levels seen in patients with Alzheimer's disease. These findings provide support for the use of neramexane as a pharmacological intervention in the treatment of dementia.

After Max sent it over, I rewrote some of the song and made it feel more me. I put my vocal on it, and it just felt special, exciting. David Guetta walked past the studio and was like, "I like this song." Emeli Sandé was like, "Oh, I heard that song and it sounded sick." And then Max was like, "I want to get Ariana to jump on it." I was like, "Yeah." She recorded her part in the following two days. Then, within a week, Nicki had heard it and was like, "I want to get on this," and it kind of became this female anthem, like a girl band. Not a feature, but a moment where all of us can really show off what makes us us. And do it together. I only met them at the video shoot, but I looked at Nicki and myself and Ariana, all three of us look so different, and we're all equally confident. I was pointing at Nicki in the video, I was like, "she's got a booty like a Cadillac, but I can send you into overdrive!" I'm not going to rival what she has, but I've got what I've got. That's what I feel like young women, especially, need to hear. You have to love yourself, before anyone else can even come in. So for me, as a slim, tall-legs-no-boobs-no-bum kind of girl, I've got to represent."

It's always satisfying when a simple theory comes along which seems to make sense of messy and complicated things. We ran a piece last year on the theoretical physicist Geoffrey West, who seems to have hit upon a "grand, unified theory of cities". It runs as follows: if a city doubles in size, then, all else being equal, a whole range of things from crime to wages will increase by around 15 per cent.

Phenomenal storyline and fun albeit simple gameplay. However, as with many Telltale games the ending is the same despite any choices (there is only one choice that matters at the end, and the change is hardly significant). In a game appluaded for it's amount of choices, as that is the majority of the game - why don't any of them matter? I feel like a branching storyline that changes after each end episode choice would be amazing, but I guess that's too much work to write all those endings.

BERHAMPUR/BHUBANESWAR: A herd of five elephants and a foetus were mowed down after being hit by a speeding train near Subalaya in Ganjam district, about 50 km from Berhampur, on Saturday night. A 40-year-old man, engaged by a private contractor as a bed-roll assistant in the train, also died in the accident.The elephants — three females, a tusker and a calf besides a foetus — were killed after being hit by the Chennai-bound Coromondal superfast express at around 1 am, official sources said. A female elephant was in the advanced stages of pregnancy and the impact of the hit forced the foetus to come out. Ranjit Jena, a bed-roll assistant working with a Chennai-based private contractor, was also found dead, though it was still unclear as to how he died during the mishap, railway officers said.Divisional forest officer, Berhampur, S S Mishra said the elephants were crossing the tracks when the train hit them one after the other, killing them on the spot. Prior to the mishap, forest staff had driven out the herd from Dumanagiri jungle, he added. The DFO said around 20 elephants from Chandaka elephant sanctuary near Bhubaneswar had migrated to the area a few months ago. They were roaming in the Chilika wildlife division area and Khallikote range of Berhampur forest division after splitting into two to three groups. A herd comprising 12 elephants had crossed the railway track before the accident, he said.The accident, which marked the most number of pachyderm deaths in a railway mishap in Odisha, took place between Humma and Rambha railway stations (between Khurda Road and Berhampur) under the Khurda Road railway division of East Coast Railway (ECoR), possibly due to poor visibility caused by foggy conditions, official sources said.Train services between Berhampur and Bhubaneswar were disrupted on the fateful track for about seven hours after the accident as some portions of the line were damaged. "Railway services were restored at about 7.45 am after the track was repaired and the carcasses removed," said a railway officer. The Howrah-Chennai Coromondal Express also left the place and proceeded towards its destination after a halt at Berhampur station, where the partially damaged engine was replaced.Forest and environment minister Bijayshree Routray expressed shock over the mishap and said: "I have information that 10 days ago the range officer, Khallikote, had informed railway authorities that an elephant herd is likely to cross over the track anytime in the night. A month back the state government had also provided fluorescent signages reading 'elephant crossing zone', which railway officers had put up between the 10-km stretch connecting Rambha and Ganjam stations. Despite all this, such a tragedy took place." He said he has convened a meeting with railway officers on Monday and if required would urge chief minister Naveen Patnaik to take up the matter with the Centre.On May 18, a female elephant had died near the same spot after being hit by a goods train. Other animals, including a wild boar, have also been killed in train accidents in the area in recent times, sources said.

It's 1950 on San Pedro Island in the American Pacific Northwest. Commercial fisher Carl Heine Jr.'s dead body is pulled out of the water in a fishing net by his crew, he who died of head trauma. Kazuo Miyamoto is charged with his murder. Carl and Kazuo were once friends, had known each other since childhood, but WWII has placed a strain on any sort of relationship between the ethic Japanese and Caucasian populations of the area, the Japanese population which was and is still substantial on the island. Carl had motive regarding a land dispute between the two families, land which Carl's mother eventually sold from under the Miyamotos and which Carl had just repurchased. Evidence also points to Kazuo being on the water with Carl probably sometime during his last voyage, evidence which Kazuo knew would put him in a bad light, adding on top of being Japanese, and thus decided not to disclose to the investigating sheriff at the time he was questioned. Kazuo and his wife Hatsue's fear come ... Written by Huggo

The preseason doesn't matter. We run through the same stuff every year, only with different faces. There's the bad team that looks great in meaningless action. The reclamation project at quarterback who looks revitalized and new. The unknown prospect who runs through third-team defenses for big plays. Occasionally, those teams and players do turn out to deliver on their promise, but there are so many washouts and false positives to go with those success stories that it's impossible to figure out who is for real until the meaningful football starts in September. Let's put the preseason in some context to understand how it's not worth taking too seriously.

When Deadpool director Tim Miller unexpectedly stepped away from his Deadpool 2 directorial duties in October, it was widely reported that it was due to creative differences with the film's star, Ryan Reynolds, and that the two had "increasingly butted heads over certain creative issues." Miller has remained mum on the reasoning behind the decision, but he's now finally speaking out about what caused him to depart the R-rated Marvel universe. "I just want to say one thing to the geek audience out there because it's important to me what the geeks and nerds of the world think because they are my brothers and sisters: I didn't want to make some stylized movie that was three times the budget," he said on CG Garage. "If you read the Internet, who cares, really? But for those of you who do, I wanted to make the same kind of movie that we made before because I think that's the right movie to make for the character. So don't believe what you read on the Internet. I wanted to do the same thing." It was recently announced that David Leitch — perhaps best known for John Wick — will be assuming the role of Deadpool 2's director in Miller's place.
(CBS News) Nearly five weeks into the launch of HealthCare.gov, the management expert brought in to turn around the website says its issues are fixable. But it's going to take weeks, not days.

The company is being sued by citizens who maintain that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, is responsible for their cancers.

And HGTV's Property Brothers gets into the action, depicting real estate agent Drew Scott searching for fixer-uppers for his client, while his identical twin brother Jonathan utilizes his contracting skills to renovate the homes.

I also didn't want to ruin the gorgeous train effect this has in the back.

With Robert's patience we chose the blended 2"medium topper. My thoughts were to put the new latex topper in place of the foam that is inside the sleep number bed. Once swapped out, I could not tell the difference between the latex topper and the original foam. So I replaced the original foam back inside the bed, and put the topper on top of the mattress. This was a huge difference, much more comfortable. We are still playing with the numbers on the mattress, but feel confident we can fine tune the settings. I'd bet a firm to medium 3" would have been better for our needs, but doubt if the 3" would not have fit inside the bed cover on the sleep number mattress, and I did not want a 3" topper on top of the mattress. Quick shipping, excellent customer service. I may be getting one for my house !!!!!

Patient prognosis in lung cancer largely depends on early diagnosis. The exhaled breath of patients may represent the ideal specimen for future lung cancer screening. However, the clinical applicability of current diagnostic sensor technologies based on signal pattern analysis remains incalculable due to their inability to identify a clear target. To test the robustness of the presence of a so far unknown volatile organic compound in the breath of patients with lung cancer, sniffer dogs were applied. Exhalation samples of 220 volunteers (healthy individuals, confirmed lung cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)) were presented to sniffer dogs following a rigid scientific protocol. Patient history, drug administration and clinicopathological data were analysed to identify potential bias or confounders. Lung cancer was identified with an overall sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 93%. Lung cancer detection was independent from COPD and the presence of tobacco smoke and food odours. Logistic regression identified two drugs as potential confounders. It must be assumed that a robust and specific volatile organic compound (or pattern) is present in the breath of patients with lung cancer. Additional research efforts are required to overcome the current technical limitations of electronic sensor technologies to engineer a clinically applicable screening tool.

Every 19 minutes, a baby is born in America to a mother who struggles with opiate addiction, a percentage that has soared in the past decade alongside a broader addiction spike. The increase has forced some state lawmakers to decide whether the mother's drug use, which can leave the baby with post-birth withdrawal called neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), is a criminal justice issue or a disease.

For years the U.S. government allowed racist white lynch mobs to murder Black men, women and children for practically nothing. The lynchings were so absurd one could argue that Black people's lives were little to no value at all. In fact, between 1882 and 1930 in just the 10 southern U.S. states of Florida, Tennessee, Arkansas, Kentucky, North Carolina, Mississippi, Georgia, Louisiana, Alabama, and South Carolina, 2,500 black people were lynched. That is an average of nearly one hanging every week.

Stanley Kubrick's film 2001: A Space Odyssey opens with one of the most iconic scenes in film history. The scene, entitled THE DAWN OF MAN, portrays a small band of early human ancestors, ape like in appearance, living amidst a harsh arid landscape. The scene unfolds and the audience is given a brief glimpse into the lives of these early hominids as they struggle to survive the barbarous conditions of their surroundings. They cower in fear at night, spend most of the day foraging the scarce plantations for food, and one poor fellow is even torn to shreds by a leopard. The creatures appear helpless and afraid, the quality of their lives completely determined by the boundaries and limitations of their external environment.

Scientists know that humans, chimpanzees, and other primates can convey surprising amounts of information by means of a glance and tilt of the head. But what about animals with eyes on the sides of their heads, like deer and horses? What kind of social cues do they use to communicate? Now, mammal communication experts report that, at least for horses, a great deal of information is conveyed through the position of the animal's ears as well as its eyes. To find out which facial cues equines use, the scientists placed two buckets of feed in front of a wall with a life-size photograph of a horse's head. The head faced either left or right. They then released 24 horses, one at a time, and let them choose which bucket to dine from. If the eyes or ears of the pictured horse were covered, the freed horse randomly selected either bucket for its dinner. But if the eyes and ears in the photo were visible, the horse (such as the one in the photo above, pictured with study author Jennifer Wathan) used these cues to guide its choice, and most often picked the bucket that the pictured horse was facing, as in this video. The study, reported today in Current Biology, serves as a reminder that creatures with faces shaped differently from those of humans and other primates can nevertheless exchange social signals, the scientists say. None of this is likely to surprise people who work with horses or dogs, they note, but then it sometimes takes a while for science to catch up.

Large in scale, the sculpture is both unsettling and humorous, irreverent and yet carefully wrought and conceptually complex.

High rollers at the big table. Only Sanders wants to break up the DC insider game ( source ; click to enlarge). by Gaius Publius An essay with a title like "The Democrats' 10-Point Plan to Lose in November" (the actual title is longer) is certainly provocative. Turns out it's an excellent analysis. I referred to it once in an earlier piece — " Media Support May Have Set Clinton Up to Fail " — and focused on just the media-related comments. But I want to give you the bones of the whole below and invite you to read it through. Are the Democrats setting themselves up for failure? I think so. Why would they do that? That's not explained in the essay, but as I've said many times, they'd rather lose to a Republican than lose to Sanders. The reason is obvious. Sanders is determined to take down the insider game they're all of them, Republicans and Democrats, playing — to their own mutual benefit and your inevitable decline . Protecting the game that enriches them all is job one, or it seems so, based on the behavior of the Democratic Party in this election. Now to that 10-point plan... The Democrats' 10-Point Plan to Lose in November The author is Seth Abramson, writing at Huffington Post. He starts: The Democrats Are Flawlessly Executing a 10-Point Plan to Lose the 2016 Presidential Election One needn't speculate about how the Democrats could end up losing the 2016 presidential election. In fact, a subtly complex, multi-part plan to do just that is exactly what the Democrats have been up to over the last six months. Here's a detailed report on the ten steps the Democrats are now taking to ensure they lose the White House to the Republicans in 2016: Now the points of that "plan" with some brief comments: 1. Assume that Donald Trump will be the Republicans' 2016 nominee, though it's now clear he won't be. After some discussion, Abramson writes: Trump has no chance whatsoever to secure the nomination at the Convention itself. Choose your reason: so-called "faithless" delegates; delegates who are free to choose whoever they wish after the first ballot; delegates "for Trump" who in fact were selected and seated by Cruz or Kasich; backroom Establishment machinations that sway delegates hoping to curry Party favor — all will conspire to deny the nomination to the man who Washington Post polling indicates would be, at the start of his campaign, one of the most unpopular political candidates in U.S. history. His own best guess as to who will be the nominee is here . 2. Nominate the only person who can reunite the Republican Party once Trump failing to get the nomination has fractured it beyond repair. Hillary Clinton is, in short, the only savior the Republican Party has left. So the Democrats are working as hard as they can to nominate her, of course. 3. Fracture the Democratic Party by broadly supporting the Clinton camp's attempts to smear Bernie Sanders and his supporters. I discussed this point with added notes here . 4. Fatally underestimate the electoral chances of the two men now most likely to be the Republican presidential nominee in November: Ted Cruz and John Kasich. Please note this if you think early head-to-head polling is inaccurate (my underscored emphasis): Clinton supporters say that general election polling isn't accurate in April. Unfortunately, we know from hard data that that's not correct. In fact, according to studies , we're right in the middle of a spike in general-election polling accuracy — right now, as in this minute. As Vox notes , "By the time we get to mid-April of an election year, polls explain about half the variance in the eventual vote split. And mid-April polls have correctly 'called' the winner in about two-thirds of the cases since 1952." 5. Fail to nominate their most popular candidate, in particular the one with the best chance of beating Ted Cruz or John Kasich in the fall. That would be Sanders, of course. 6. Freeze one of the most popular Democrats nationally, Bernie Sanders, out of the picture altogether. In 2008, when Hillary Clinton lost a hotly contested presidential nominating contest to Barack Obama, she was rewarded with the second-most powerful executive position in the U.S. government: Secretary of State. In 2016, the Clinton camp, determined to offend Sanders and his supporters, has leaked that if he continues to do well — winning about half the delegates in the primary season post-March 1st — they'll consider giving him a good speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia.... Yes, you read that right. And there's more on that subject, Sanders' "reward," in the piece. 7. Reject Sanders' call for a fifty-state general-election campaign. If John Kasich is the Republican nominee, the entire Midwest — especially Ohio, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Indiana — will be up for grabs in the fall. Given Clinton's weak standing relative to

ESSENDON has staged a remarkable second-half comeback to down Fremantle by four points at Patersons Stadium on Friday night and continue its unbeaten start to the season.The Bombers, who came into the match after a tumultuous week off the field, trailed by 37 points in the second quarter but rallied with seven consecutive goals after the main break, eventually running out 10.12 (72) to 9.14 (68) winners.After scores were locked at 66 with five minutes remaining, Patrick Ryder kicked the match-winner, the Bombers ruckman threading a left-foot snap with 90 seconds remaining to leave the majority of the 35,963 in attendance at Patersons Stadium stunned.Both Paul Duffield and Chris Mayne had last-minute chances to steal back the lead for Fremantle, but Mayne's shot hit the post with just seconds remaining.The siren heralded scenes of wild celebration from the Bombers, whose coach James Hird has come under heavy pressure to resign over the drugs controversy.After the game, Hird said he would not stand aside.He said his players had rallied around him and he was extremely proud of the way they had fought back after Essendon looked set for a heavy defeat at half time."I think coming to Perth and beating Fremantle in the form they're in is a huge win," he said."The club's under a lot of pressure in terms of the ASADA investigation so that adds a lot of weight to it."The Bombers, who kicked 28 goals against Melbourne last week, managed just one goal in the first half on Friday night as skipper Jobe Watson was held to just seven disposals.But it was a different Watson and a different Essendon that took control in the second half, squeezing the life out of the home side.Fremantle coach Ross Lyon said his side had more inside 50s, more marks inside the attacking 50, more clearances and more shots at goal, but said his players had wasted opportunities."I think there's a disappointment," he said."League football's brutal. I think we got three quarters pretty right. For whatever reason, the third quarter was really poor and they were really good."And at the end of the day you have got to take your opportunities."It took Essendon until the nine-minute mark of the second quarter to register its first goal.After losing All Australian defender Luke McPharlin to concussion in an incident with Ryder that is likely to come under the scrutiny of the match review panel, Fremantle took until the 11-minute mark of the first term to record the first goal of the match.The home side then proceeded to kick another four before quarter-time and added a further two goals in the second quarter.Hayden Ballantyne, Mayne, Nathan Fyfe and Michael Walters combined to good effect to help Fremantle kick away, though Matthew Pavlich was well beaten by Jake Carlisle.The home side had planned well for Essendon's midfield, forcing Watson to handball rather than kick thanks to the pressure of both Ryan Crowley and Matt de Boer.But Brent Stanton did break free at times, while Michael Hibberd snuck under Fremantle's guard.Everything changed in the third quarter, and it was only through some errant Bombers' kicking that Fremantle was able to retain its lead at the final change.Hird said after the match that Dustin Fletcher had some groin tightness, while Michael Hurley didn't appear to have broken his right wrist Crameri 3, Hurley 2, Kavanagh, Howlett, Kommer, Heppell, RyderMayne 3, Fyfe 2, Walters 2, Ballantyne, DuffieldHibberd, Carlisle, Hooker, Crameri, Ryder, HurleyDuffield, Fyfe, Mundy, Barlow, Ballantyne, WaltersHurley (right wrist)McPharlin (concussed), Bradley (cut head)Dustin Fletcher replaced by Travis Colyer in the third quarterLuke McPharlin (concussion) replaced by Cameron Sutcliffe in the first quarterNilMargetts, Farmer, Mollison35,963 at Patersons Stadium

On Sunday, December 27th, I sat in my office stressed out. A big campaign we had launched in November had not taken off like we hoped it would. The idea had received some coverage on California TV , Huffington Post, and the Washington Times but we really needed much more if we wanted to make the idea happen.
Land Ordinance of 1785 Passed by the Congress of the Confederation on May 20, 1785, this is considered one of the most important legislative acts in American history. In 1780, the original 13 states began to cede their claims to land between the Appalachian Mountains and the Mississippi River. At the same time, a debate developed over how to dispose of those lands once they were acquired by the federal government. Some people believed that the lands should be surveyed into uniform units before sale, while others thought that individual speculators should be able to make their claims as they saw fit. The Ordinance of 1785 was a compromise solution. The ordinance decreed that the federal government would survey the lands into individual townships, each of which was to be six miles square. These townships would then be subdivided into 36 lots of 640 acres (one square mile) each. These lots could then be further subdivided into rectangular units. Once this had been completed, the townships were to be sold at public auction for not less than $1 an acre. The ordinance also contained a provision setting aside one lot in each township to provide funds to maintain public schools. As the United States acquired further territory -- as in the case of the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 -- the ordinance was applied to these new lands, until eventually its jurisdiction stretched to the Pacific Ocean. The first federal survey of Western lands was conducted in 1781 in eastern Ohio by Thomas Hutchinson. That survey produced the map below.
Ghost 2001 is a very large black and white digital photograph mounted on an aluminium lightbox that depicts a horse with a spiralled horn protruding from its head. The horse's muscular body is shown in full from its right side, and is reared up so that its two front hooves are raised in the air. There are slight shadows under the horse's back hooves and its thick, flowing tail reaches to the floor. Its head is turned slightly towards the viewer and the horn between its ears is reminiscent of that of a unicorn. The horse fills most of the space in the photograph and the background consists of a grey and black void. The image is based on a scanned reproduction of the highly celebrated oil painting Whistlejacket c.1762 (National Gallery, London) by the British artist George Stubbs (1724–1806), which depicts a deep brown-coloured racehorse against a plain beige background. Stubbs's painting is reproduced at its original scale in Ghost, giving the horse a monumental quality that emphasises its physical power. The tones of the black and white reproduction are reversed so that the image appears in negative. As a result, the sharp white of the animal's body contrasts with the dark background, an effect heightened by the illumination provided by the lightbox.

The "Justice Pool" is composed of a limited number of users that are active on the Virtue Poker network. In order to become a Justice, users must acquire VPP, stake VPPs in the Justice Registry, and must have their machine on and their application open and set to "active" in order to be assigned to tables. The assignment rate of Justices to tables is based on an individual Justice's stake divided over the total number of tokens locked in the Justice Registry. If a Justice is caught cheating, colluding, or misreporting hand results, that Justice's stake is seized and is kicked out of the Justice Pool. Justice submissions will be reviewed prior to a Justice removing their stake (plus fees accrued) from the registry. See here to learn more about the Justice System on Virtue Poker.

Health follows a socioeconomic status (SES) gradient in developed countries, with disease prevalence falling as SES rises. This pattern is partially attributed to differences in nutritional intake, with the poor eating the least healthy diets. This paper examines whether there is an SES gradient in one specific aspect of nutrition: fast-food consumption. Fast food is generally high in calories and low in nutrients. We use data from the 2008, 2010, and 2012 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) to test whether adult fast-food consumption in the United States falls as monetary resources rise (n = 8136). This research uses more recent data than previous fast-food studies and includes a comprehensive measure of wealth in addition to income to measure SES.

The Balfour Declaration is just 67 words - one very long sentence on a small piece of paper issued on November 2nd 1917. But the effects of that sentence are still felt to this day across the Middle East. In the ferment of debate generated by the centenary of the Balfour Declaration this year David Reynolds goes back to its historical roots: to find out how and why it was conceived. Because that document cannot be understood apart from the dramatic autumn of 1917, when the Great War hung in the balance. Britain's Russian ally was on the verge of collapse amidst revolution. The Ottoman empire's military success against British imperial forces was now finally foundering. After the terrible British setbacks of Gallipoli, Kut & disappointment in the war for the Holy Land, General Allenby was finally poised for victory in Palestine. On December the 9th he was able to grant prime minister Lloyd George his Christmas present of Jerusalem's 'liberation' from centuries of Ottoman rule. By that time the fateful Balfour Declaration had been issued in London. Its impact could barely be absorbed across war torn Palestine still suffering the privations of famine, plague and conflict . In London, the small Zionist movement were delighted by their role in shaping the Declaration yet they were just part of a tangle of British imperial planning that, in late 1917, had seen a chance to decide the war and also define the peace. Manipulating Jews and Arabs, Russia and America, British decision makers were convinced of their ability to pull the strings of world politics. But not for the first time (or the last) British leaders would become victims of their own hubris. The very long sentence was a very British story.

In the past ten years, the problem of vestibulitis has been increasingly recognized as a cause of painful sexual intercourse. Women with this disorder report "burning" pain that is right at the opening (vestibule) of the vagina. In more severe cases, the pain is present during normal daily activities, as well as during sex. Careful examination reveals redness and unusual sensitivity of the tissue at the opening of the vagina. It seems to be what is called a "neuro-inflammatory" condition. This means that inflammation starts (for any one of a long list of reasons, such as vaginal infection) which causes pain; the nerves involved in sensing the pain then release chemicals that promote inflammation, and this inflammation causes further pain. Thus, a "vicious cycle" gets started that can last for years Although this problem is not caused by any single factor, it can be aggravated by acid foods in the diet, by low levels of estrogen hormone, and by any infections that happen to occur while it is there. At the same time, it seems that many treatments bring about at least some relief in some women. The regimen we use now is one we have arrived at as the result of over 10 years of experience in treating this disorder, having tried many different treatment methods. Our most successful treatment has been a combination of estradiol (estrogen hormone) and lidocaine (local anesthetic) compounded in a special preparation. Applied three times daily over 6 to 8 weeks, many women note considerable improvement. In some cases, we add medications that seem to interrupt the abnormal sensitivity of the nerves, such as tricyclic antidepressants and anti-epileptic drugs, medications that have been shown to be effective for "neuropathic" (abnormal nerve function) pain. When pelvic muscles have become abnormally tight as a result of the pain, we find pelvic muscle exercises helpful, sometimes assisted by pelvic floor biofeedback done by a physical therapist. Medical measures bring about sufficient relief in about 8 of 10 women. For those still having pain after medical measures have been used for a number of months, we offer a surgery (vulvar vestibuloplasty) that has proven successful in over 90% of cases. We try medical measures first, however, because they are so often successful, and the surgery involves 10 days of rest at home afterward, following by several months of further treatments to the sensitive vaginal tissue before comfortable sexual relations can resume. We have performed approximately 150 of the vestibuloplasty surgeries, and have made a number of improvements in the procedure over the years.We've tried a number of treatments that have been popular for short periods of time and found them unhelpful in the long run. These include laser treatment, interferon injections, low oxalate diet, and pelvic floor biofeedback as a primary treatment method. Finally, we recognize that long years of unhappy sexual life can cause great strains on a relationship. We have developed a list of counselors skilled in dealing with marital and sexual issues, and often encourage counseling as part of recovery.

After spells in prison, he reinvented himself as a stuntman, businessman and spy, becoming a double agent during the Second World War. His highly developed ability to fool people finally paid off for his country: he survived a five-day interrogation by the German secret service and convinced them he was a traitor. By doing so, he supplied British intelligence with key insights into enemy operations. Yet little more than a decade later, at the age of 57, he was discovered penniless and alone in a London bedsit, having apparently killed himself. Who was this extraordinary man? That's the question that Walter Dicketts' granddaughter, Carolinda Witt, has tried to answer ever since she discovered his identity in 2008, 10 days after her mother Effie died at the age of 87. Witt has written the story of the exploits of her grandfather in a book called Double Agent Celery – MI5's Crooked Hero, to be published next month. If Walter Dicketts specialised in secrets and lies, there was none more painful for Effie than going to her grave never knowing her father's name or what he had done. Mona Vale author Carolinda Witt has written a book on the colourful life of her grandfather, Walter Dicketts.

At its most basic, a term for the economic uncertainty and existential angst associated with the dissolution of fixed employment, precarity also suggests the disintegration of stable societal bonds, occupational identities, social protections and a sense of entitlement and belonging characteristic of the old proletariat. In short, then, precarity is the experiential dimension of the crisis of the society of work dating back to the 70s and 80s.

I think I'm having an emotional affair. I started going to a new evening class a few months ago, and I've become powerfully attracted to a man on my course. Nothing has happened, but we have an obvious connection, and I often catch him looking at me. We have an online study group and send each other private messages – nothing flirtatious, just links to articles or funny jokes. I've realised that seeing him has become the highlight of my week. I don't think I want anything to happen between us, but it has changed how I behave around my husband. Is this a phase, or a sign of something more serious?

The state shaped pans are a set of skillet pans with each one shaped like a different state in the country to scale, besides of course Alaska and Hawaii. Alaska would make a pancake 4 feet across, while Hawaii would have to be like 5 different pans. Perfect for making a batch of eggs in the shape of Massachusetts, a tater-tot hot dish in the shape of Minnesota, or a giant pancake in the shape of California, the state shaped pans range in price heavily, where Rhode Island will just cost you a mere $150.00, where Texas is going to run you $2,500.00. So just hope the person you're buying this for lives in one of those tiny New England states.

So in the past two weeks I have been sexually harassed, almost hit by a car, and seen a bum masturbate ten feet away from me. Thank you cta and thank you Chicago.

Why is it I can't even ride a train without having to worry about being harassed in some sort of way. Fuck the city. It really isn't worth it to me. I am so fucking stressed about this.

Using a vast swath of data spanning the past six decades, Unequal Democracy debunks many myths about politics in contemporary America, using the widening gap between the rich and the poor to shed disturbing light on the workings of American democracy. Larry Bartels shows the gap between the rich and poor has increased greatly under Republican administrations and decreased slightly under Democrats, leaving America grossly unequal. This is not simply the result of economic forces, but the product of broad-reaching policy choices in a political system dominated by partisan ideologies and the interests of the wealthy.

Guys shouldn't write stories about girls. Well, actually they (we) (I) can't. Why? Quite obviously, guys don't know anything about girls. Other than they're different. Really different. We live on separate planets, men and women. It's proven. Many long and detailed leather bound books have been written on the subject. And while a guy like me shouldn't write about women, I'm still going to try. Even at the risk of being ridiculed and sandblasted. I feel compelled, and even if this is a story that doesn't venture into the mysterious vortex of "how girls think and why," it does discuss their effect on something we're all incredibly passionate about.Yes, this is a story about girls in mountain biking. And it's written by a guy (me).Wish me luck.When it comes to mountain biking, there aren't too many women around. Sure, go to a cross-country race, or certain special nodes in the world, like Whistler, and they're there. And many of them rip, make no mistake. But throughout the evolution of our sport, and even in the context of per capita participants today, women in mountain biking represent a small percentage. The big official stats from the Outdoor Industry Association (OIA) claim a 2:1 men to women ratio across all mountain bike disciplines in the U.S. Dive behind the scenes into Facebook Insight stats from some of the sport's larger companies (I had access to one) and it suggests a much smaller percentage, perhaps as low as 10%. So, to be fair, somewhere between 10% to 30% of all mountain bikers are female. Which sucks, and, in my opinion reflects negatively on our sport. In many different ways.Firstly, as someone who grew up mountain biking, I had to endure (along with many of my friends) the pains of a girl vacuum. In the 80s and 90s there were NO girls mountain biking. Some would suggest the reasons are obvious. But I prefer to not believe that scars and mud and eating shit on a regular basis pushed women away. Maybe so. But really, think about it, humans are some 4 million years into this thing called evolution. Girls have endured a lot more than pedal bites and broken wrists throughout their history. You could even argue that they're tougher than men when it comes to pain and suffering. I would put childbirth in brackets but that might get me flogged.Not having girls around at the outset of the sport has dramatically influenced its development. This is a dude sport. Companies are run by dudes. The big pro athlete contracts are signed by dudes. Bikes are primarily designed and built for dudes. Pretty much all of mountain biking's imagery and marketing is dude-centric. It's basically a dude-o-sphere populated by massive dudeness that can only, by virtue of its almighty dude, continue down the one-way road to dude-town.Which sucks. Look at surfing. God, I wish I were a surfer. Girls all over the place. And I'm not saying this because I like bikinis and wet bodies and all that wonderful stuff (which I do of course, I'm a dude for crissakes!), but in the want to be somewhat cultured and intelligent (which can be hard for dudes), I know that girls add a certain element of balance to any endeavor. They are smarter, cooler and much more grounded than dudes, especially the athletic ones. Not to mention, quite simply, they represent the other half of our species. We need them, in more ways than we know or are willing to acknowledge.Secondly, not having girls involved in mountain biking in a significant way has greatly diminished the potential of our sport. Because of the dude brigade, and the fact that only 10% to 30% of mountain bikers are women means that our sport is that much smaller. Imagine if it were 60-40, or even better, 50-50? If there are 7 million mountain bikers in the United States right now (2012 OIA stat), we could increase that number by a few million participants. Which is a huge deal. More jobs, more mountain bike economic muscle, more critical mass, more people working with, riding on, and loving bicycles. And the Good Lord only knows, if there is one thing this planet needs right now it's more people riding bicycles (especially girls).Thirdly, because girls don't play an equal role in our sport, it's my belief that we've created a girl backlash of sorts. And I get it. Dudes like to ride with dudes. And we give'r. And sure, while we like to ride with girls, it doesn't seem to happen much. At least in the circles I ride with. Today, girls (for the most part) seem to prefer riding with girls. And sure, this happens in many facets of society—go to a dinner party and it's girls on the couch and dudes on

TORONTO — NDP Leader Tom Mulcair has raised the case of imprisoned Canadian journalist Mohamed Fahmy with Egypt's ambassador to Ottawa. In a phone call which took place on Tuesday, Mulcair emphasized the importance of getting a response from Egypt's president to a pardon application and a deportation request filed in Fahmy's case. An Egyptian court sentenced Fahmy to three years in prison on Saturday, marking the climax of a trial in which he had been accused of widely denounced terror-related offences. The NDP says Mulcair told the Egyptian ambassador Canadians are very worried about the imprisoned journalist. The party says Ambassador Motaz Zahran acknowledged Mulcair's concerns and agreed to relay them to the Egyptian president. The NDP says Mulcair also noted that swift action to resolve Fahmy's case by Egypt's president would be noted by the NDP, which would like to maintain the "strong" relationship between Canada and Egypt if the party forms government in the upcoming federal election. "Mohamed Fahmy is being jailed for doing his job as a journalist. That's why the Canadian government should be doing something to help Mohamed Fahmy," Mulcair said in a statement after the call. "Prime Minister Harper should pick up the phone and talk to the Egyptian president and try to get some answers as to how this is possible." The Department of Foreign Affairs has said Canadian government officials have raised Fahmy's case with Egyptian officials "at the highest level" and would continue to do so. Fahmy was working for satellite news broadcaster Al Jazeera English when he was arrested along with two-coworkers in December 2013 and has always maintained his innocence. His family has urged the Canadian government to do all it can to set him free.

According to food lore, Spaghetti Carbonara is a relatively new addition to Italian cooking.. In fact, one of the theories is that Spaghetti Carbonara came about due to food shortages during World War II. Another theory is that coal miners may have invented the dish. (I'm not buying that theory.) Or… that the black specs of freshly ground black pepper – and you should add a good amount of pepper – resemble coal dust lying atop a bed of spaghetti mixed with eggs and cheese. Actually, who cares where or why the recipe originated? We love it because it's easy to make and delicious!

"But if we had a choice, we'd like to escape from Beijing."

Oculus has been ordered to pay half a billion dollars in a lawsuit with games company ZeniMax. According to Polygon, a jury awarded the sum after determining that Oculus executives violated a ZeniMax non-disclosure agreement in the early days of building the Oculus Rift VR headset. But it also decided that Oculus wasn't guilty of misappropriating trade secrets, another of ZeniMax's charges. Polygon writes that the $500 million award is composed of $200 million for NDA violation, plus $50 million for copyright infringement, a $50 million award against both Oculus and co-founder Palmer Luckey for false designation, and $150 million against former CEO Brendan Iribe for false designation. The overall award is less than the $4 billion that ZeniMax asked for, but it's a substantial judgment against Oculus, and one that the company plans to appeal.

This article explores the social(ist) pedagogies of the Brazilian Landless Workers Movement (MST), a large agrarian social movement that fights for socialism in the Brazilian countryside, meaning that workers own their own means of production and collectively produce the food and other products necessary for their communities' survival. Over the past three decades, activists in the movement have developed an alternative educational proposal for rural schooling that supports these new social relations of production. Drawing on major theories of reproduction, cultural production, and resistance in the field of education, I argue that three theorists—Paul Willis, Paulo Freire, and Antonio Gramsci—are critical in assessing the role of schools in processes of social reproduction. I examine four components of the MST's social(ist) pedagogy: the incorporation of manual labor into public schools; the promotion of collective learning; counter-cultural production; and linking schools to concrete political struggles. Drawing on Willis, Freire, and Gramsci, I argue that the MST's educational proposal is a limited but real attempt to interrupt dominant social relations of production in the Brazilian countryside, thus representing a unique example of social pedagogy in the 21 century.

Rated 5 out of 5 by DontTouchMyStuff from Great Meter for Electricians and DIYer's I purchased the 117 based on reviews and the Fluke reputation; it is my third digital multimeter and second Fluke (the other is a clamp DMM I use mostly for testing amperage). Despite the ambiguous complaints posted by others, this is a solid multimeter. The large 6,000 count display makes the meter easy-to-read and understand; as long as you are looking directly at the screen. My only (minor) complaint is if the screen is looked at - even slightly - from above, the digits disappear, but for me this is only a minor inconvenience. The meter feels solid and robust in the hands and not easily damaged. The non-contact voltage sensor is very sensitive, especially when set to "HI", which makes it ideal when checking for electrical wires inside of walls. I have zero "buyer's remorse" and will use this meter for a long time.

The Social Construction of Reality is a 1966 book about the sociology of knowledge by the sociologists Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann. ... Knowledge and people's conceptions (and beliefs) of what reality is become embedded in the institutional fabric of society. Reality is therefore said to be socially constructed.

Before I begin my review I should probably state how I got to this book and what expectations I had. About a year ago I read Ready Player One by Ernest Cline and absolutely fell in love with it, going so far as to recommend it to everyone who was capable of reading basically. Of course that was a debut novel and so there wasn't more I could immediately delve in to and so I started looking around for similar books but there weren't any obvious contenders. Now of course this was part of the reason
In a bold step toward remedying the world's least pressing health issue, the FDA recently approved an over-the-counter topical spray to treat premature ejaculation. (Similar products have long been available, but this is the first to win FDA approval.)

Promescent's website boasts that it "benefits both men and women by helping a man have staying power." Become an endurance champion through the magic of a medically deadened penis, I thought. Okay!

The city of Harbin in northern China is closing down airports and schools thanks to a perfect storm of air pollution, according to a report from the New York Times. Particulate matter in the city's air has reached record-setting levels, prompting local government to advise citizens to stay in their homes as local hospitals saw a 30 percent surge in admissions from respiratory problems. Visibility is less than 10 meters in many parts of the city, which has made driving both difficult and dangerous, and the Times quotes the city's official news site as saying, "You can't see your own fingers in front of you."
Advanced molecular materials that combine two or more physical properties are typically constructed by combining different molecules, each being responsible for one of the properties required. Ideally, single molecules could take care of this combined functionality, provided they are self-assembled correctly and endowed with different functional subunits whose strong electronic coupling may lead to the emergence of unprecedented and exciting properties. We present a class of disc-like semiconducting organic molecules that are functionalized with strong dipolar side groups. Supramolecular organization of these materials provides long-range polar order that supports collective ferroelectric behavior of the side groups as well as charge transport through the stacked semiconducting cores. The ferroelectric polarization in these supramolecular polymers is found to couple to the charge transport and leads to a bulk conductivity that is both switchable and rectifying. An intuitive model is developed and found to quantitatively reproduce the experimental observations. In a larger perspective, these results highlight the possibility of modulating material properties using the large electric fields associated with ferroelectric polarization.
After inaugurating New Mexico's use of private prisons, Johnson made it his top political priority to install a school voucher system (an effort that failed because of the legislature's opposition). He also annulled public employees' collective-bargaining rights, slashed funding for social programs, reduced taxes for the wealthy, implemented one of the country's strictest welfare-reform programs, and pushed for harsher sentencing laws. In 2002, the libertarian Cato Institute could only lament that the Democratic legislature was standing in the way of Johnson's bold agenda. The Republican governor, Cato raved , "has done much to create private-sector jobs and to erode the culture of dependence on government in New Mexico."

Warren Wright has not spoken a public word since his daughter, Warriena Wright, was found dead at the base of a Surfers Paradise apartment tower in 2014. And he's not starting now, it seems. "I'm sorry you've come so far," he says. "But there's nothing more to say." Somehow, though, over the next hour we share a beer and chat. "Is that your red hire car there?" he says, nodding towards the kerb. "Did you get lost? The cats told me you were here 15 minutes ago." It's true, I say, I drove down the street, made some notes and checked if one of Warriena's friends had emailed. I ask where Warriena got her love of animals. His blue eyes sparkle. "Well, that would be me. I have cats as guard dogs." The 58-year-old semi-retired electrician is a little wary of people. "I never trust a human being. I taught both my daughters that. And then Warriena went and trusted him." Warriena Wright worked in a Kiwibank call centre in an ugly office tower near the Wellington waterfront. On her desk was a row of little plastic figurines from one of her favourite Japanese anime television shows, Dragon Ball Z. At night, Wright, who was 26 when she died, returned to Lower Hutt, where she lived with her younger sister Marreza. To travel there by car, I skirt around Wellington Harbour for 15 minutes, steep flanks of pine-green hills on my left. In a quiet street in the working-class suburb of Epuni, I find the place Wright called home: a modest white brick house behind a high fence. On weekends, Wright and a small crew of close female friends, including Marreza, gathered here to play computer games such as the role-playing Final Fantasy.

A spokesperson for Universal Cartographics released the following statement: "Commanders started noting discrepancies between the exploration records stored in their ship systems and their own personal records. When we investigated, we found that one of our contractors has purposely altered a recent firmware update that was applied to all discovery and surface scanners. We also found that the contractor had a connection to Emperor's Dawn. An arrest warrant has been issued, and our staff worked through the weekend to recover the encrypted data and replace the compromised firmware."

It's 8:50 P.M. at the Kelly File studio. The crew dudes finish shining her glass desk, through which viewers can see her shapely legs. Two makeup women, armed with blow-dryer and hair spray, put the finishing touches on her glistening tresses. And Megyn Kelly, Fox News's breakout prime-time star, girded in a snug black dress and four-inch strappy heels, is champing at the bit to make another presidential contender—this time Jeb Bush—squirm in his seat. "If it's fair to question Mrs. Clinton for failures leading up to [Benghazi]," she says, looking into the camera at her 2.7 million viewers, "why is it unfair to question Jeb about his brother's failures leading up to September 11, 2001," as Donald Trump had just done. She turns the question to Jeb, speaking via satellite video hookup. "Is it a double standard?" "Trump doesn't know what he's talking about," replies Bush. She points out that Jeb's in fifth place in the polls, and she wants to know, "What would it take to make you get out [of the race]?" Bush, looking as if he were wearing a scratchy, too tight suit, replies that he's going nowhere. In the face of Donald Trump's taunts, what's his plan? "To me," says Kelly, "it seems like you don't know what to do. You're like, 'How am I supposed to respond to this?' " He smiles forcibly and tries for a joke. "We're in the same boat, Megyn," he says, referring to Trump's recent attacks on Kelly. She beams appreciatively but refuses the bait. "Well, but I'm not running for president." The moment the interview is over, Bush bolts from his chair, grim and grouchy. The control room, alight with numerous monitors, is buzzing with excitement. "He's not happy. I didn't even get to thank him," says a young associate. "You can tell he's on edge," calls out another. "All through the interview, fake smile, fake smile. Soon as it's done, no smile." Unnerving would-be leaders, blowhards, and didacts from both parties has become Kelly's specialty, as the world learned in August. The first television journalist to call Trump out face-to-face on his obnoxiousness, she kicked off the first Republican debate by calmly cataloguing Trump's sexism in a single question. To recall: "You've called women you don't like fat pigs, dogs, slobs, and disgusting animals.... You once told a contestant on Celebrity Apprentice it would be a pretty picture to see her on her knees. Does that sound to you like the temperament of a man we should elect as president, and how will you answer the charge from Hillary Clinton … that you are part of the war on women?" Trump tried to laugh it off mid-question, saying that those insults were directed only at Rosie O'Donnell, but Kelly wouldn't let him off. He then complained, "Honestly, Megyn, if you don't like it, I'm sorry. I've been very nice to you, although I could probably maybe not be based on the way you've treated me." The following night, he suggested to Fox News's rival network CNN that the reason she was so hostile was that she was probably menstruating: "You could see there was blood coming out of her eyes, blood coming out of her wherever." When that didn't rattle her, Trump lashed out on Twitter, calling her a "lightweight," re-tweeting that she was a "bimbo," and stoking his supporters to boycott her show. Kelly took the high road and said on-air that she had no reason to apologize to Trump, and that she would "continue doing my job without fear or favor." Kelly's Trump episode was one in a string of satisfying male-ego deflations that have helped her surpass cable's biggest news star, Bill O'Reilly, in the key demographic of 25–54 for three months in 2015. Her occasional, yet highly entertaining, bucking of the conservative party line has attracted more independent-minded viewers and has even earned praise from liberals such as Chris Matthews, Joy Behar, and Gayle King. As of late, passersby have been calling out versions of "It's not too late to come to the other side!" Still, some media types warn against getting too excited over Kelly. As Bill Maher put it, "We think of Megyn Kelly as the sane one over there at Fox News. It's just because she's surrounded by Hannity and Bill O'Reilly. She's like the blonde dragon girl on Game of Thrones. Everyone else is a zombie or a dwarf or fucking their sister, so she looks normal." Whatever the case, Kelly has become a feminist icon of sorts—the sort who won't

Musharraf puts his luxury London flat on sale for £3m LONDON: Former military ruler Pervez Musharraf has put his luxury Central London pad for sale asking for almost £3 million. Musharraf had bought the house for £1.3 million in 2009 when he settled in London after leaving Pakistan. He purchased the property in cash and does not have a mortgage on itThe flat was recently refurbished and a source has told The News it has cost the former president about £250,000 for the renovations. The entire interior has been changed to increase the value of the flat, said the source. The estate agent, marketing the sale of the flat, has put the flat's price at £2,950,000 which means that the former president could make more than £1.5 profit from the sale. The 4 bedroom flat on Castleacre, Hyde Park Crescent, near Edgware Rd and Marble Arch is located on the 9th floor with a double room reception and two baths. It has views over Hyde Park corner and is considered a desirable location for the rich and famous. Present Pakistani politicians and those politicians belonging to the previous government have their properties located at only a few minutes' distance from here. The closest neighbour of Musharraf at this address is former prime minister Tony Blair. Some website has estimated the price of Musharraf's flat at £2,063,126. London is seeing rise in property value after the slump in recent years and it's believed that the fat could be easily sold at the current asking price. Pervez Musharraf's friends have investments in London. One of his closet confidantes runs a profitable consultancy business while another has interests in property development. Circles close to Musharraf rejected the impression that these businesses belonged to the former military president of Pakistan. They said everybody knows that Musharraf is not involved in such things. The Pakistani officials reaching London and the intelligentsia among those Pakistanis living in Britain are having a perception that Musharraf plans to spend most of his time in Dubai when he leaves Pakistan after a deal, which, according to them, looks set and in place. Musharraf is aware that he will not have the security provided by the British government again due to the controversy that it may cause and also for the fact that Musharraf went to Pakistan against the advice of everyone, including the British government officials who warned him that he is risking a lot by going to Pakistan. It is at this flat that Musharraf held meetings of his party colleagues and invited media for interviews.

Beyond that, the service points out the convenience factor and its commitment to safety, commenting also that wider choice and competition for customers shouldn't be considered a bad thing. Basically, this is Uber's veiled rebuttal to all the arguments against it, but it's still got some love for black cabs, it seems. Uber calls them "arguably the best taxis in the world," adding afterwards, however: "there is room for more and better."

that she was adopted by a wealthy school headmaster, named Anjou. When he finally gets to the house (more like a mansion, actually), he is happy to be reunited with his little sister - only to find out that there are two girls who could be her. The documents for the adoption have mysteriously disappeared, the orphanage was burnt down, and Yousuke only remembers the last syllable of his imouto's name: ". . . yu." One girl's name is Mayu, and the other is Ayu. Both of them remember having an onii-chan, but, much like in Yousuke's case, they have forgotten how theirs look like or what their brothers were called, and have little clues for the answers. Their father begins to doubt Yousuke, and gives him one week to discover who is the real sister, or he must leave, as a man. To make things even more complicated, another girl appears later whose name is Nayu, and she claims to have been in the same orphanage as Toyokawa's . . .I like the story. It is not a frequent setting (I know about Onegai Twin, but still . . .), and it continues in a funny style with supernatural abilities, though intended for humor, such as "Imouto (Little Sister) GPS," which enables the person to find his little sister, or someone he cares about just as much, instantly, though it can only be used by perverted brothers. By the way, although some chapters may feel that way, this manga is not really slice-of-life. There is either a strong development between the characters or some new ones are introduced. Occasional dramatic moments are also present, especially in the end.There are not many main characters here, but these ones are quite sufficient. Toyokawa Yousuke is a guy who tries to do the right thing when possible (or impossible) if it comes down to his little sisters, or later Nayu. The one first mistaken to be the lost sister is Anjou Mayu, a beautiful, shy fifteen-year-old girl who warms up to Yousuke pretty quickly, calling him "onii-chan," despite not being sure whether they are related or not; she plays the violin well with her orchestra. Described by her father to be similar to a watchdog when it comes to Mayu, her few-months older adopted sister, Anjou Ayu is the outspoken one of the two, and continuously rejects Yousuke's kind gestures (though he is prone to tongue-slipping absent-mindedly sometimes), beating him up whenever she feels he did something wrong; basketball is a sport she enjoys (heh, reminds you of Shindou Kei (Ef) much?). Last but not least is Nayu, a gorgeous lady who is like a mixture of Ayu and Mayu, having the former's straightforwardness and the latter's attractiveness (she resembles Myamura Miyako (Ef) more, though (except the part about her cat)); despite the fact he hardly remembers her, she used to be in the same orphanage as Yousuke, and was often protected by him, resulting in her falling head-over-heels for him; furthermore, Nayu somehow seems to be able to talk to her black cat.A colorful set of characters that you would just want to see how they interact with each other or what they are going to do next. I respect the protagonist, Yousuke; he is an honest man that always does his best for the sake of his imouto, willing to sacrifice anything for them, even at the cost of his own happinesss. The series starts out pretty good, but just as you are getting used to things, Nayu comes in the picture, and hilarity sky-high rise; she provides a stronger rivalry for Mayu in order to have Yousuke's affection, better than the already existing love triangle which includes Ayu. Others of lesser importance also appear, with their own quirks, such as a swimming instructor that likes the sisters as well.Ayu Mayu (or "Ayu Mayu Nayu," as I like to call it, since Nayu is of equal importance to the other two) is an innocent, cute manga that shows the good side of perverts and what they are willing to do for the sake of their imouto. You can expect some fan-service, romance, love triangles, and, of course, comedy. Recommended to those looking for something light and short to read. You will not regret reading this one.

Whether or not Ghostery is an ad blocker depends on how you define "ad blocker." Also depends on who you ask. It's an awkward question for a company that wears two seemingly different hats in the online ad industry. The first is as one of two primary privacy compliance technology providers powering the Digital Advertising Alliance's (DAA) debatably toothless AdChoices program. (TRUSTe is the other.) Ghostery works with ad tech vendors to dynamically serve that ubiquitous little blue AdChoices icon into the top right corner of ads across the Internet. The second is as the maker of a popular browser extension and app that lets consumers manage their preferences around third-party tracking. Users can also choose to block content either across the board or on a case-by-case basis. Ghostery CEO Scott Meyer vehemently disagrees that Ghostery, née Evidon, is in the same category as Adblock Plus and other unapologetic ad blockers. He's called the opacity of the Adblock Plus Acceptable Ads program "just a form of extortion," language echoed by Interactive Advertising Bureau President and CEO Randall Rothenberg at every opportunity. Meyer also argues that there isn't any potential conflict in his company's business model. But getting paid by ad tech companies on the DAA side while offering a tool that includes ad blocking functionality on the other rubs some industry pundits the wrong way. "The way I see it, ad tech companies pay a ton of money to Ghostery because it's involved with the DAA, while Ghostery demonizes the ad tech folks in order to build up the Ghostery [consumer] user base and we – when I say we, I mean the 40 or 50 companies I've chatted with about this over the last several years – have a general level of discomfort about this," said Alan Chapell, president of privacy consulting firm Chapell & Associates and a vice chairman of the Network Advertising Initiative's board of directors. But just because the model is a little tricky doesn't mean there's anything nefarious going on, said Jim Spanfeller, CEO of Spanfeller Media Group and former CEO of Forbes.com "They're probably coming from a well-intentioned place," Spanfeller said. "But there's a debate to be had about Ghostery's tactics." In the ad tech industry, there are many such debates to be had.

The fact that so many books still name the Beatles as "the greatest or most significant or most influential" rock band ever only tells you how far rock music still is from becoming a serious art. Jazz critics have long recognized that the greatest jazz musicians of all times are Duke Ellington and John Coltrane, who were not the most famous or richest or best sellers of their times, let alone of all times. Classical critics rank the highly controversial Beethoven over classical musicians who were highly popular in courts around Europe. Rock critics are still blinded by commercial success. The Beatles sold more than anyone else (not true, by the way), therefore they must have been the greatest. Jazz critics grow up listening to a lot of jazz music of the past, classical critics grow up listening to a lot of classical music of the past. Rock critics are often totally ignorant of the rock music of the past, they barely know the best sellers. No wonder they will think that the Beatles did anything worthy of being saved. In a sense, the Beatles are emblematic of the status of rock criticism as a whole: too much attention paid to commercial phenomena (be it grunge or U2) and too little to the merits of real musicians. If somebody composes the most divine music but no major label picks him up and sells him around the world, a lot of rock critics will ignore him. If a major label picks up a musician who is as stereotyped as can be but launches her or him worldwide, your average critic will waste rivers of ink on her or him. This is the sad status of rock criticism: rock critics are basically publicists working for major labels, distributors and record stores. They simply highlight what product the music business wants to make money from. Hopefully, one not-too-distant day, there will be a clear demarcation between a great musician like Tim Buckley, who never sold much, and commercial products like the Beatles. At such a time, rock critics will study their rock history and understand which artists accomplished which musical feat, and which simply exploited it commercially. Beatles' "Aryan" music removed any trace of black music from rock and roll. It replaced syncopated African rhythm with linear Western melody, and lusty negro attitudes with cute white-kid smiles. Contemporary musicians never spoke highly of the Beatles, and for good reason. They could never figure out why the Beatles' songs should be regarded more highly than their own. They knew that the Beatles were simply lucky to become a folk phenomenon (thanks to "Beatlemania", which had nothing to do with their musical merits). That phenomenon kept alive interest in their (mediocre) musical endeavours to this day. Nothing else grants the Beatles more attention than, say, the Kinks or the Rolling Stones. There was nothing intrinsically better in the Beatles' music. Ray Davies of the Kinks was certainly a far better songwriter than Lennon & McCartney. The Stones were certainly much more skilled musicians than the 'Fab Four'. And Pete Townshend was a far more accomplished composer, capable of entire operas such as "Tommy" and "Quadrophenia"; not to mention the far greater British musicians who followed them in subsequent decades or the US musicians themselves who initially spearheaded what the Beatles merely later repackaged to the masses. The Beatles sold a lot of records not because they were the greatest musicians but simply because their music was easy to sell to the masses: it had no difficult content, it had no technical innovations, it had no creative depth. They wrote a bunch of catchy 3-minute ditties and they were photogenic. If somebody had not invented "Beatlemania" in 1963, you would not have wasted five minutes of your time reading these pages about such a trivial band. Extended note from 2010. The Beatles were not a terribly interesting band, but their fans were and still are an interesting phenomenon. I can only name religious fundamentalists as annoying (and as threatening) as Beatles fans, and as persevering in sabotaging anyone who dares express an alternate opinion of their faith. They have turned me into some kind of Internet celebrity not because of the 6,000 bios that i have written, not because of the 800-page book that i published, not because of the 30 years of cultural events that i organized, but simply because i downplayed the artistic merits of the Beatles, an action that they consider as disgraceful as the 2001 terrorist attacks. Jakub Krawczynski sent me this supportive comment in 2010: I find it quite amusing that almost all of the Beatles songs have their own entries on Wikipedia (nothing wrong with that in itself, actually), even if they are not singles, and each of them is meticulously dissected as if there were transcendental suites exceeding human comprehension, yet bands like Faust or Red Krayola, etc. have biographies even shorter than just one article about any random Beatles song. Needless to say, none of their songs have any articles on them, yet I'm sure there would be a lot more to

Just purchased item so can't speak to its long term durability, but I will say so far garment appears to be an economical and practical substitute to rather similar items marketed for men. (And I believe those items would cost 2-3 times as much unless bought "on-sale", but I can find this everyday at this price.) Because of the relatively long leg on the garment I find it perfectly suitable for my male anatomy . (Ain't nuttin' gonna' fall out, know what I mean, man?) There is of course no male 'pouch' in the front, but I find the material gives enough that it doesn't matter. With its light overall compression I find the garment comforting and gently supportive. For me it is a functional and economical alternative. You can spend more for a more macho looking garment if that matters to you, but why? I can't afford to! The sales associate was very helpful, even suggesting an appropriate size (size 8 for my 5'8", 180#, 60 year old body, (and she was right on the mark). I have since discarded all my "white-ty tight-ties" and ordered more of these.

For many years, I've been an avid fan of video game music (or VGM). To be precise, my love started with Square's Final Fantasy VI, back when it first came out. During my experiences as a young boy, wandering through the enchanted forest, interrupting a live performance and saving the world from a psychopath. I steadily grew to appreciate the various synthesized sounds; how well they matched the classical music I'd been learning, as a musician in middle school. I loved it so much, that I recorded it and using a Playschool audio recorder. (C'mon, I was 11 years old and on a budget!!)

NEW DELHI: The BJP on Wednesday strongly disapproved of the controversial comments its MP Adityanath comparing Shah Rukh Khan with Pakistani terrorist Hafiz Saeed , terming them "uncalled for" which did not reflect in any way the core belief of the party or Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Heaping praise on the Bollywood superstar, who was also attacked by senior party leader Kailash Vijayvargiya on Tuesday, BJP said there cannot be any comparison between a law-abiding Indian citizen and a Pakistani terrorist."There cannot be any comparison of any law-abiding Indian citizen with a terrorist like Hafiz Saeed, certainly not Khan who is a much loved and respected Indian national and artiste," BJP spokesman Nalin Kohli said. His (Adityanath) comments are incorrect and uncalled for. They do not reflect in any way the core belief of BJP or that of Prime Minister Narendra Modi ," he said.Pushed on a defensive not long after party chief Amit Shah had warned some party leaders against making controversial statements in the wake of the Dadri lynching and beef row, BJP leaders also referred to Union minister Prakash Javadekar 's condemnation of Vijarvargiya's comments to make it clear that the party did not approve of them.Vijarvargiya had on Tuesday accused Khan of echoing the voice of anti-national forces, alleging he may live in India but his soul lived in Pakistan. He withdrew his tweets on Wednesday.BJP secretary Srikant Sharma accused Congress of "sponsoring" the campaign by writers, artistes and scientists against the "climate of intolerance", saying it was resorting to these tactics to get over its internal leadership crisis and that it had still not reconciled to Modi's leadership."There is peace in the country but disquiet among Congress leaders over the leadership of Rahul Gandhi. So its leadership has resorted to these tactics. It is its intolerance to Modi's leadership as India is doing well on every front and it cannot accept this. So it is sponsoring these protests by so-called writers many of whom had made an appeal to defeat Modi in Lok Sabha elections," he said.

Wargaming, SEGA and Creative Assembly are moving forward today in a new partnership that sees Total War: ARENA published worldwide as the first ever title released by Wargaming's new publishing label, Wargaming Alliance. Wargaming Alliance is dedicated to providing third-party publishers and developers the tools, resources and platform to enter the highly competitive free-to-play gaming market along with access to Wargaming's substantial subscriber base of over 100 million gamers.Total War, one of the key pillars of the SEGA business, is one of the most successful and influential strategy franchises of all time, mixing massive battles with deep tactical and strategic elements. Total War: ARENA, developed by Creative Assembly, brings those franchise tenets into the world of free-to-play gaming by blending the series' trademark strategic experiences with intense 10-vs-10 player battles. Creative Assembly's expertise, combined with Wargaming's proven track-record in the free-to-play market, makes Total War: ARENA the perfect fit for Wargaming Alliance.To answer some of your questions:We are very proud of ARENA and the unique multiplayer battle experience it offers. The Closed testing last year confirmed the significant potential ARENA has. The publishing deal with Wargaming opens the game up to a huge, brand new community and is a strong fit with the game.It doesn't affect the relationship at all. Both SEGA and Creative Assembly identified a commercially beneficial deal with the best interests of Total War: ARENA at heart. The fact that CA's console team is working on Halo Wars Two as well, just underlines their agility and talent when it comes to developing games across a range of platforms and disciplines.This deal is for publishing ARENA only.Yes it's the same development team, but it's grown to allow us to meet the objectives for the game.While the core mechanics remain the same, following user tests and working closely with Wargaming the game's balance, user interface and more have been redesigned and rebuilt to provide players with a better experience. In the time to come, we'll be providing insight on the various changes we've made.Yes, the game is still free to play.Currently the focus is on PC only.Recent development work has included significant changes to the game including the balancing, progression and hosting platform. All of this means it was not possible to keep game progression. However because the game's progression system now feels different to what it was before, it's unlikely that players will feel like they're having to cover old ground.No, the game will be available via the Wargaming Game Center platform. It is a new platform which will include all Wargaming products with single entryYour old game account will no longer work. You will need to create a Wargaming Game Center account to be able to play ARENA. Sign up here: www.TotalWarArena.com Yes, if you used to play any of Wargaming Trilogy games: World of Tanks, World of Warships or World of Warplanes, you will be able to use the same account to play ARENA. Please take in consideration that during Alpha and Closed Beta stages special activation key will be required in order to access the game. We will be providing more information on how to get one later on.We are still working on the timings for this, anyone who owns ROME II or is part of the Vanguard group will receive a special reward, more on this at a later date.To play in the Closed test phases you will need to sign a Wargaming NDA as part of the sign up process. The SEGA NDA will no longer be valid.That depends on the progress of the early alpha tests. We will let you know as soon as we have a confirmed date. You can submit your email for latest news and Closed Beta information now at TotalWarArena.com.Sign up at www.TotalWarArena.com The game will be in Alpha stage and later on in Closed Beta to allow for testing and balancing and will move to Open Beta once we have completed that process.Europe, CIS, US, Asia but not China.Yes, there is a dedicated, localised Chinese version of Total War: ARENA being worked on as well, though it is not part of our partnership with Wargaming. We will bring you more information soon.The ARENA subforums will not remain open.To stay informed with game news go to:

The federation also issued a wallet card that lists prohibited substances and gave one to Sharapova's coach, Sven Groeneveld, in January, the report said.
Richard Dawkins (1) begins his review of E.O. Wilson's (2) new book The Social Conquest of Earth with an appeal to authority—namely the 137 evolutionists who co-authored a reply (3) to an article by Martin Nowak, Corina Tarnita and Wilson in Nature magazine (4). Appealing to authority is a risky business in science, as Dawkins appreciates, because scientific progress often involves the few prevailing against the many. Nevertheless, Dawkins' appeal to authority acknowledges something that everyone should know about group selection, kin selection, and all that: Dawkins and Wilson are only two of dozens of scientists who have been working on the issues over a period of decades. This is in contrast to their outsized images on the public stage, as if they are the only two figures meriting attention and all the important ideas sprang from them.

The impact of record-keeping on the course of history cannot be overstated. For example, the act of preserving Judaism and Christianity in written form enabled both to outlive the plethora of other contemporary religions, which were preserved only orally.

Its impact could be equally large. It is called the blockchain.

Here's the entire layout as it exists in January of 2012. The left hand portion is the original built on a 36" x 80" door. The right hand portion is the new yard, representing Enola, PA, on a 24" wide door. Background: This is my fourth layout and the second representing the PRR in N scale. My last layout depicted PRR coal operations around Shamokin, PA in the summer of 1956. The new layout, like the last, is built on a 36x80" hollow-core door with folding legs. The new layout seeks to correct some of my mistakes of the last, and depicts a fictional segment of the PRR in central Pennsylvania inspired by the Middle Division - rather than Northern Division - operations. The layout is called the "Juniata Division (pronounced jōō' nē - āt' ə )" after the Juniata River followed by the real PRR's Middle Division from Duncannon to Altoona, PA. The real PRR Middle Division became part of Conrail's Pittsburgh Line in 1976 after the Penn Central failure. I've recently started building a Conrail roster to simulate Conrail operations circa 1980. Trackplan: The left hand side of the trackplan above i s based on one Lou Sassi did in Model Railroader in the early 90s (and in the Second Edition of Kalmbach's Small Railroads You Can Build) called the Mohawk Valley. I changed a few sidings and industries, but otherwise kept the general concept intact. I also added a yard with an engine terminal on the right in 2009. Concept: Recreating an actual location on the Pennsy's four-track Broad Way of Commerce would have been difficult in my limited space. Instead, I've chosen for now to model a fictitious segment of the PRR (until that wonderful day when I can accurately recreate the PRR in that dream basement) and am attempting to capture the essence of the PRR's Middle Division. I tried to make the towns "sound" Pennsy, such as East Mifflin, Jack's Run, and the main focus, Lewisport (a combination of Lewistown and Newport, both on the Middle Division). Even the mine is "almost right." The PRR served 42 Berwind-White Eureka coal mines (and hauled Berwind's massive fleet of privately-owned hoppers), so my kitbashed Walters mine is Eureka 43. The time is July 1956, the last full year of steam operations on the PRR. Diesels, trailers on flat cars (TOFC), and track reductions are starting to change the image of the mighty Pennsy but some of the past is still very much there, from the wood-and-brick interlocking towers to the freight house with its PRR Merchandise Service trucks parked out front. My version of the Middle Division has two instead of four tracks, but the spirit is there even if the space is not! Even in 1980, Conrail was still using three tracks, so I'm still a little behind. Construction: The layout is built on a 36"x80" and a 24"x80" hollow-core door with folding, telescoping H-legs These legs were purchased on-linehere. The scenic base is 2" extruded Styrofoam. Scenery is Styrofoam with Sculptamold. Rockwork is Mountains-in-Minutes flexrock castings. Ground cover comes mainly from Woodland Scenics, although I've used some natural dirt I sifted and "baked" myself. Track: I used Atlas code 80 flextrack with Peco Insulfrog code 80 turnouts on the original part of the layout. Minimum mainline radius is 13.5" and turnouts are #8 on the mainline and #6 on sidings. Why code 80 and not that beautiful Atlas code 55? This layout has to move with me every few years (I'm in the Air Force) and go with me to shows where it will take a beating. I just felt the code 80 had a better chance of surviving! However, the rail height and oversized ties as well as the unrealistic rail profile bothered me to the point that I used Atlas code 55 on the new extension. I'm very glad I did. Control/Signals: I'm using the Digitrax Super Empire Builder DCC set. Yeah, I know, it's more than I need for such a small layout, but (see above) I plan on using it later some day on the "big one." Wiring is 14 AWG solid for the track bus, 24 AWG for the feeders, and 18 AWG stranded for signaling. Signals are NJ International PRR 8-bulb position light signals (some absolute stop, some permissive). Mainline signals are fully animated using Logic Rail Technologies SAD-3 Signal Animators. Read about how they work here. Sidings have toggle switches allowing

The purpose of this study was to determine what effects 26 wk of resistance training have on resting energy expenditure (REE), total free-living energy expenditure (TEE), activity-related energy expenditure (AEE), engagement in free-living physical activity as measured by the activity-related time equivalent (ARTE) index, and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in 61- to 77-yr-old men (n = 8) and women (n = 7). Before and after training, body composition (four-compartment model), strength, REE, TEE (doubly labeled water), AEE (TEE - REE + thermic response to meals), and ARTE (AEE adjusted for energy cost of standard activities) were evaluated. Strength (36%) and fat-free mass (2 kg) significantly increased, but body weight did not change. REE increased 6.8%, whereas resting RER decreased from 0.86 to 0.83. TEE (12%) and ARTE (38%) increased significantly, and AEE (30%) approached significance (P = 0.06). The TEE increase remained significant even after adjustment for the energy expenditure of the resistance training. In response to resistance training, TEE increased and RER decreased. The increase in TEE occurred as a result of increases in both REE and physical activity. These results suggest that resistance training may have value in increasing energy expenditure and lipid oxidation rates in older adults, thereby improving their metabolic profiles.

The recent announcement that Random House will merge with Penguin Books to form a new joint venture fulfills the expectations of many observers of the trade publishing scene. Consolidation is inevitable, the argument goes. The big will acquire the small and join forces with the other bigs. Big is better.

But even if it is true, it does not seem inappropriate to investigate what the rationale for bigness is. After all, such transformative companies as Mendeley and Pinterest started with a tiny staff. Big is big, but small can become big, too, if it understands the dynamics of the Internet and can scale rapidly.

BRISTOL, CT—Sensing the 9-year-old is now old enough to engage in a heated debate on the subject, Stephen A. Smith reportedly decided Monday that his son is finally ready for the sex argument. "It's a big milestone in every father-son relationship to sit your child down and dispute his pathetic ideas about the birds and bees," said Smith, fondly remembering his own father belligerently talking over him when he got the sex argument as a boy. "He's at that age where he's starting to hear some things about sex at school, so it's important for me as a parent to corner him on his logical inconsistencies and force him to admit he doesn't have the experience to know what the hell he's talking about." Smith said he is ready to have the argument as soon as his son gets home from school and can get in front of a camera.

timeseal WHAT IS TIMESEAL?! Timeseal is a program that has been developed to improve chess on internet. Netlag often causes players to lose valuable seconds or even minutes on their chess clocks. Transmission time is counted against you, unless the chess server can tell exactly when information is transmitted. The timeseal program acts as a relay station and keeps track of transmission times. What timeseal does is record your thinking time, so that transmission time is not counted against you. Timeseal will not prevent netlag but it makes the games fairer when lag occurs. (For other ways to handle the impacts of lag, read "help lag".) HOW DO I USE TIMESEAL?! Some interfaces have timeseal built into them; examples are Fixation (finger Adum) and PowerICS (finger Kossy) for Macintosh systems, WinBoard versions 3.6.0 and higher (finger Mann) for Windows 95 and Windows NT, and CClient (finger Plotinus). To use these programs, make timeseal active before you logon to the chess server. Finger the program authors for up-to-date information on their interfaces. Other users must get a version of timeseal working on the computer that connects to the chess server. In most cases, you must run timeseal on the computer host that links you to the chess server. The version of timeseal you need will depend on the operating system used by your host computer. You will need to identify which version you need, download it and make it ready for use. Because computer operating systems differ, there are different versions of timeseal. For further details, see the separate help file for your operating system. There are separate files currently for Macintosh, Windows and Unix systems: help timeseal_mac help timeseal_os2 help timeseal_unix help timeseal_windows Others will be added as they become available.

Now, he is endorsing a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports to pay for the wall.

A person who adopts or appropriates the transgender label or identity, for political reasons. Unlike Transgender individuals, who exist all across the world, and hold a wide variety of political views, transtenders are exclusive to the left, and their identities are an extension of the intersectional feminist belief that gender is completely socially constructed. TransTrenders do not experience gender dysphoria , and will often identify as non-binary, Agender , or otherkin . TransTrenders further otherise Transgender individuals, because they use their made up "identity" to bully and police others on behalf of transgenders as a whole, though they do not actually represent them. They often obnoxiously demand the use of made up pronouns, like "Ze, Zir , Zim." TransTrenders are not to be confused with a trangender individual who experiences gender dysphoria but is not, or has not started transitioning. TransTrenders are also not to be confused with someone who is transgender, and happens to be an intersectional feminist. At their core Transtrenders are opportunistic, totalitarians, who despise everyone, especially genuine transgender individuals, because their transition within the binary, runs counter to their idea that there is no binary.

The self-glorying fantasies of NBC News "managing editor" Brian Williams multiply with every passing day, most recently and risibly his boast that he looked down the very tube of the RPG launcher that shot down the chopper in front - which is quite an accomplishment at that altitude - and the evolving numbers of three-week-old puppies he's rescued from blazing buildings. So I thought it would be appropriate for our Saturday movie date to pick another tale of journalistic fabulism - Billy Ray's 2003 biopic of a New Republic fantasist, Shattered Glass:

Look at the cover of the new Gorillaz album for longer than a passing glance and you'll begin to notice an uncanny resemblance between the 3D renditions of the virtual band's animated members and some other notable musicians. While not yet explicitly addressed by anyone from the Gorillaz team, each "bandmate" bears an uncanny resemblance to a fairly iconic face. I can't be completely sure, but from my perspective here are the allusions: 2D is Jack White, Noodle is Björk, Russell is Cee-Lo Green, and Murdoc is Noel Gallagher. The iconography is hard to miss, yet save for an uncredited Gallagher, none of these artists shows up anywhere on Humanz, the band's fifth studio album, neither in flesh nor even in spirit. Their depiction here rather seems like another bit of irreverent pop-star gagging by Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett, who have been wringing out ambiguous satire from their cartoon art-pop project for almost two decades now.

It's old news to true Star Trek fans, but 2016 marks the 50th anniversary of the franchise, and Paramount & CBS, co-owners of the property in it's various televised and film forms, are doing everything they can to keep Trek as fresh and relevant to audiences as possible. We've got a new film, 'Star Trek Beyond,' hitting theaters next month; it's the third entry into the "alternate timeline" universe first helmed by JJ Abrams back in 2009. In addition, work has begun in earnest on a new TV series for the franchise. It is as-of-yet untitled, but it is slowly garnering a Trek-centric all-star behind-the-scenes cast, and that group has recently been made larger with the addition of a few writers from the franchise's former series.

The endocannabinoid (eCB) system has attracted attention for its role in various behavioral and brain functions, and as a therapeutic target in neuropsychiatric disease states, including anxiety disorders and other conditions resulting from dysfunctional responses to stress. In this mini-review, we highlight components of the eCB system that offer potential 'druggable' targets for new anxiolytic medications, emphasizing some of the less well-discussed options. We discuss how selectively amplifying eCBs recruitment by interfering with eCB-degradation, via fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), has been linked to reductions in anxiety-like behaviors in rodents and variation in human anxiety symptoms. We also discuss a non-canonical route to regulate eCB degradation that involves interfering with cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Next, we discuss approaches to targeting eCB receptor-signaling in ways that do not involve the cannabinoid receptor subtype 1 (CB1R); by targeting the CB2R subtype and the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1). Finally, we review evidence that cannabidiol (CBD), while representing a less specific pharmacological approach, may be another way to modulate eCBs and interacting neurotransmitter systems to alleviate anxiety. Taken together, these various approaches provide a range of plausible paths to developing novel compounds that could prove useful for treating trauma-related and anxiety disorders.

Coronary heart disease rates have been reported in several parts of the world to be unusually high in people originating from the Indian subcontinent. High coronary disease rates appear to be common to South Asian groups of different geographical origin, religion, and language. This presents a challenge to the understanding of coronary heart disease: the high rates in South Asians are not explained on the basis of elevated serum cholesterol, smoking or hypertension. Low plasma HDL cholesterol, high plasma triglyceride levels and high prevalence of non-insulin-dependent diabetes have been consistently found in South Asians overseas: this probably reflects an underlying state of insulin resistance. Further studies are needed to determine whether this metabolic disturbance can account for the high rates of coronary heart disease in South Asians, and to identify possibilities for prevention.
In the first year after he was charged with the rape and murder of a child, Phillip James Tallio wrote his teenaged girlfriend 116 letters, every one of them repeating the same thing. He said it before his trial and after his conviction, and when he was sentenced to life in prison. For more than 34 years he said it, over and over, and he would not stop. He said it to family members and to correctional staff, in prison programs and to the parole board, even though he knew saying it meant he would not be released. When people told him to stop saying it, so at least he could get out of prison and have some kind of a life, he told them he would never admit to something he didn't do. And then he'd repeat the same thing he'd been saying for 34 years: I didn't do this.

Economic debates rarely end with a T.K.O. But the great policy debate of recent years between Keynesians, who advocate sustaining and, indeed, increasing government spending in a depression, and austerians, who demand immediate spending cuts, comes close — at least in the world of ideas. At this point, the austerian position has imploded; not only have its predictions about the real world failed completely, but the academic research invoked to support that position has turned out to be riddled with errors, omissions and dubious statistics.

Ever heard that mineral oil can actually dry out your skin? Or cause premature aging? Mineral oil is one of the most commonly used oils in skin care products, but it often gets a bad rap. Here's what's fact and what's fiction when it comes to this frequently used moisturizer.
I devised My Old Man to pose a simple question: if you were asked to write about your father, what would you say? There was no other brief for the project, and no typical answer. Contributions for both the blog and the book that followed have varied drastically between sweet and sour, fond and tragically fraught, but the one unifying factor is that everyone – be they a writer, a teacher or a pop star – has a unique story to share about their father. And every tale is heartfelt. Nobody lies about their dad.

Cubic boron nitride (cBN) is a well known superhard material that has a wide range of industrial applications. Nanostructuring of cBN is an effective way to improve its hardness by virtue of the Hall–Petch effect—the tendency for hardness to increase with decreasing grain size1,2. Polycrystalline cBN materials are often synthesized by using the martensitic transformation of a graphite-like BN precursor, in which high pressures and temperatures lead to puckering of the BN layers3. Such approaches have led to synthetic polycrystalline cBN having grain sizes as small as ∼14 nm (refs 1, 2, 4, 5). Here we report the formation of cBN with a nanostructure dominated by fine twin domains of average thickness ∼3.8 nm. This nanotwinned cBN was synthesized from specially prepared BN precursor nanoparticles possessing onion-like nested structures with intrinsically puckered BN layers and numerous stacking faults. The resulting nanotwinned cBN bulk samples are optically transparent with a striking combination of physical properties: an extremely high Vickers hardness (exceeding 100 GPa, the optimal hardness of synthetic diamond), a high oxidization temperature (∼1,294 °C) and a large fracture toughness (>12 MPa m1/2, well beyond the toughness of commercial cemented tungsten carbide, ∼10 MPa m1/2). We show that hardening of cBN is continuous with decreasing twin thickness down to the smallest sizes investigated, contrasting with the expected reverse Hall–Petch effect below a critical grain size or the twin thickness of ∼10–15 nm found in metals and alloys.
This year's SENS rejuvenation research fundraiser has three weeks to go, and there are now two challenge funds with money left to match your charitable donations: the $150,000 fund established by Michael Greve's Forever Healthy Foundation, and today Josh Triplett has added another $20,000 above and beyond his generous donations earlier in the year. Thus donations to the SENS Research Foundation made now will be matched twice. Give $100 and a total of $300 will go towards expanding the SENS research programs aimed at bringing an end to age-related disease, frailty, and mortality, an end to the suffering and pain that accompanies aging today. In addition there are still matching dollars left to encourage people to become SENS Patrons. Sign up as a monthly donor to the SENS Research Foundation before December 31st, and Josh Triplett, Christophe and Dominique Cornuejols, and Fight Aging! will match the next year of your donations. If you know someone who hasn't yet decided on the charity he or she will support this year, then point out the good work of the SENS Research Foundation.

Butane (n-butane) Works well at high altitudes but burns poorly below 40° F due to poor vaporization at low temperatures. Butane is commonly used in backpacking and portable stoves, lighters, small torches and as a propellant for aerosol cans. Boiling point: 31° F (-0.5°C). Fuel will not vaporize well below its boiling point.

This one is a little tricky. There's a lot of debate out there over how long it takes the Falcon to make the trip. Depending on who you listen to, the time is said to be anywhere from 2 hours to 2 days. First of all, two days seems like too long of a time to take to make a rescue. Leia would probably have been dead by the time Luke and everyone got there to save her. But on the other hand, two hours seems a bit too fast to get there, even for a movie that's two hours long. And, the two hours may be a mistake, albeit an understandable one. In the film, Han says, "We should be at Alderaan about 0200 hours." He's not giving the time it takes them to get there. He's giving the time of destination in military time. That puts their arrival time at 2 a.m. When they leave Tatooine, they do so during the day, not at night. We know it's during the day because the movie establishes that Tatooine has a night, with Luke watching the planet's twin suns set. Now, we don't know exactly when they leave, but we can assume it's not first thing in the morning. Han never struck us as the type to get up at the crack of dawn. Plus, the Mos Eisley Cantina probably doesn't open that early either. A safe guess is probably somewhere between noon and 2 p.m. This means that it was a twelve to fourteen hour trip from Tatooine to the Death Star. We hope there were rest stops along the way.

For a while now, I've been making maps for my backcountry trips. I'm mainly doing this because, unlike the UK, North America doesn't necessarily have great maps for every area.

To fix this, I've dived into the world of creating your own maps. There are a lot of different tools out there to do this, and honestly no one tool is perfect. Even if it was, there is no one data source either.

Today, at the Qualcomm Snapdragon Tech Summit, Microsoft and Qualcomm officially unveiled the first ARM-powered Windows 10 laptops. These devices, referred to as Always Connected PCs, are always on, always connected (via LTE), and promise "incredible" battery life. How incredible? Well, depending on how much you use them, you could see around 22 hours of active use/a month of standby between charges. The first full-featured Always Connected PCs come from HP and ASUS (Lenovo also has devices set to be revealed in the coming weeks) and are built around the Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 chipset running Windows 10 (Windows 10 S out of the box, but with the option to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro) and a new, optimized version of Office 365. There are downsides to the new Always Connected PCs, most notably that 64-bit Windows apps aren't currently supported -- though that will change in the future -- and neither are programs that require kernel mode drivers, like anti-virus software. Despite that, this is an exciting new category of PC -- and one that will evolve and improve over time. How well they'll run full desktop programs, which will be handled via emulation, is a big question, and one we'll have to wait to find out the answer. The devices revealed today are: ASUS NovaGo is the world's first Gigabit LTE laptop, with superfast download speeds allowing users to download a 2-hour movie in just 10 seconds. Powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 Mobile PC platform with X16 LTE, the NovaGo is always on, always connected with a battery supporting 30 days of standby and 22 hours of active use. The HP ENVY x2, an Always Connected PC, combines the best of a smartphone experience with the best of a Windows PC. Impossibly thin and incredibly durable, the HP ENVY x2 offers lightning-fast 4G LTE2 and Wi-Fi. With up to 20 hours of active use battery life, the detachable PC provides flexibility and connectivity to perform daily tasks while on the go. Terry Myerson, Windows and Devices Group Executive Vice President, describes his experience of using an Always Connected PC: The screen is instantly on whenever I pick up the device. I never have to wait for it to wake up, it's just on. Being always connected wherever I am whether I am in the car, airport or coffee shop, always being connected just feels like the most natural, safe and secure way to work with teams and be creative. Lastly, the battery life is just awesome! I am finding myself charging it once a week. When I was using a wearable that needed to charge every day, I didn't really rely on it. Once I moved to a Fitbit that only needed charging once a week that was game changing for me. Not carrying around power cords is liberating.

A little over a year ago I provided installation scripts along with this post to help setup a completely redundant ELK Stack. This post has definitely been one of my most popular posts that I have ever put out and lot's of great feedback provided. Over the past few months I have been working on getting all of this functionality and then some ported over to Ansible which has proven to be amazing to say the least. However the missing piece has been providing this out to the community for consumption as well as getting additional feedback in areas that could be improved on. So I am now putting this all together (Hopefully in a consumable way) and providing this to the great community. As always this will be a working guide on setting this all up as I am sure that I will miss pieces here and there as I release these playbooks. I have spent a good bit of time trying to make these playbooks as customizable as I can allowing for them to fit within any environment. I am of course open to any ideas or thoughts on how to make these even better.

I am not infrequently challenged about why I worry so much about women in academia when young men are being disadvantaged. This is seen to be particularly true in school exam results but also if one looks at the numbers of men entering certain university courses (Veterinary Sciences, Psychology, English…). Woman's Hour ran a story on this very issue just last week. All is not perfect for boys and men, I have no doubt of that, Nevertheless for many of those women who do try to climb the academic ladder pernicious issues remain, all too often buried beneath the surface. This means the playing field frequently remains tilted very much against them. Think Geoff Marcy, who seems to have got away with harassment for far too long, as an extreme example: just because some boys/men are disadvantaged does not mean women are always getting more than their fair share or even being treated in a halfway decent fashion.
Phylogenetic relationships of 79 caniform carnivores were addressed based on four nuclear sequence-tagged sites (STS) and one nuclear exon, IRBP, using both supertree and supermatrix analyses. We recovered the three major arctoid lineages, Ursidae, Pinnipedia, and Musteloidea, as monophyletic, with Ursidae (bears) strongly supported as the basal arctoid lineage. Within Pinnipedia, Phocidae (true seals) were sister to the Otaroidea [Otariidae (fur seals and sea lions) and Odobenidae (walrus)]. Phocid subfamily and tribal designations were supported, but the otariid subfamily split between fur seals and sea lions was not. All family designations within Musteloidea were strongly supported: Mephitidae (skunks), Ailuridae (monotypic red panda), Mustelidae (weasels, badgers, otters), and Procyonidae (raccoons). A novel hypothesis for the position of the red panda was recovered, placing it as branching after Mephitidae and before Mustelidae+Procyonidae. Within Mustelidae, subfamily taxonomic changes are considered. This study represents the most comprehensive sampling to date of the Caniformia in a molecular study and contains the most complete molecular phylogeny for the Procyonidae. Our data set was also used in an empirical examination of the effect of missing data on both supertree and supermatrix analyses. Sequence for all genes in all taxa could not be obtained, so two variants of the data set with differing amounts of missing data were examined. The amount of missing data did not have a strong effect; instead, phylogenetic resolution was more dependent on the presence of sufficient informative characters. Supertree and supermatrix methods performed equivalently with incomplete data and were highly congruent; conflicts arose only in weakly supported areas, indicating that more informative characters are required to confidently resolve close species relationships.

If Google Images were your only portal into the life of Steve Weatherford, you might think he was a men's magazine model or bodybuilder, not a top-rated punter for the Giants with a Super Bowl ring and a 46.9-yard average last season. As an online glut of shirtless pictures shows, Weatherford has one of the most defined bodies in the NFL, a distinction he maintains with an almost monomaniacal obsession for training that's earned him a reputation throughout the league. "As I punter, I don't need a six-pack or to weigh 220 pounds, but that's a lifestyle for me and I love it," Weatherford says. "And even if fitness didn't make you look good, I'd still do it—though no one is going to complain if you have a six-pack and 18-inch arms."

The company isn't giving curious motorists more than a teaser picture of the car's backside at this stage, but leaks and spy photos suggest that the new Volt will be cheaper and sleeker than its predecessors -- likely necessary given that the Chevy hasn't been as popular as some of its rivals. The revamp will be part of the 2016 model year, so it's safe to say that you'll get to take the wheel within months of the unveiling.

THE 2018 JBRD Halloween Pack
Vacation was lovely, thank you for asking. And, how did I get welcomed home? By getting mugged, thankyouverymuch. At the grocery store, of all places. I'm fine. I wasn't hurt, but the guys who robbed me made off with my wallet, which not only had a wad o'cash in it, but also a drivers license with a kind of awesome photo from when I was really having a good hair and makeup day. Damn them. And, if I may risk sounding girly for just a moment, my wallet was really cute and took a long time to find, so I'm actually kinda pissed about that more than anything. Cancelling credit cards was easy, and luckily, I didn't have anything else of value in there. But I miss my wallet. Maybe Mike Bloomberg can buy me a new one, since he's decided not to run for President and thus will have some extra cash to spend on me. Maybe if you see this wallet in a store near you , you'll let me know. Isn't it adorable? Let's talk about this dish, because I've been looking forward to making it for a little while now. The only two times I've ever eaten rabbit were in fine dining establishments -- first, in 1992 at Le Cirque and later, in 1999 at Picasso in the Bellagio. I haven't ordered rabbit since then, although I've seen it on a few menus. And, I've never cooked it. When I started this project and was going through the list of dishes, I was excited to try rabbit. I'm not quite sure why, because it's never been one of those meats I've had a hankerin' for, nor have I ever yearned for the smell of rabbit cooking in my house. I think it's because I knew I liked it, but I didn't know why -- and if I made it myself, maybe I'd be able to figure it out. The day before I knew I wanted to serve this, I made the fennel oil. I blanched the fennel fronds and the parsley (separately), and ice bathed them. I drained and dried them off, and put half those green lovelies into my blender along with some canola oil. I turned the blender on medium, then high, and whacked them until they were smooth. I added the remaining parsley and fennel in small batches until everything was a blended, smooth purée. I put the purée into the refrigerator overnight. The next day, I florped it onto some cheesecloth, and rigged it onto my Kitchen Aid mixer so that the fennel oil would drop out into a bowl below. The French Laundry Cookbook suggests that you secure the cheesecloth over the top of a container, and spread the mixture on top and let the oil drip down. I've done it that way before , but had difficulty this time getting it to work, so I improvised. It tasted great, so yay for me. While the fennel oil dripped (for about an hour or so), I cooked the fennel. I trimmed off the top and root ends of the fennel bulbs, and cut a small "x" into the bottom of each. I put the fennel into a pot, covered the bulbs with cold water, and added some thyme, star anise, fennel seeds, a bay leaf, and some kosher salt. I brought the water to a boil, covered the pot, and let it simmer for 40 minutes. At that point, the fennel was nice and tender all the way to the core. I drained the fennel before putting it into a container and storing it in the refrigerator until I was ready to do the final steps before plating. Now, on to the main event. The rabbit. That package has four rabbit saddles in it, and I only needed three in this dish, so I've got an extra rabbit in my freezer, which I can't wait to experiment with in the next week or so. But enough about me. Let's talk about the bunnies. Oh, sorry. Does it bother you that I just referred to them as bunnies? Some of my friends were kind of grossed out when I told them I was making rabbit. It wasn't as bad a rejection as a certain celery dish , but no one was really all that thrilled to try rabbit. One of my younger tasters outright refused to try it, laughing in the face of my one-bite rule. I wonder if it had anything to do with me taking the package of meat out of the fridge the night before when they were visiting and making the package dance around the kitchen to "Here Comes Peter Cottontail." Perhaps I stepped over the line with that one. Perhaps. But I'm getting ahead of myself. Shocker, I know. BACK TO THE RABBIT AND

Katie wrote about the bombshell revelation that former FBI Director James Comey had long decided not to charge Hillary Clinton for anything relating to the investigation into whether she mishandled classified information last year. The former first lady had set up a private emails server from which she conducted all official State Department business while she served as secretary of state in the Obama administration. This was made known by the Senate Judiciary Committee, who sent a letter to the FBI demanding more documents on the matter. Comey reportedly drafted his exoneration statement in April or May of 2016. While Comey did tear into Clinton and her associates for being extremely careless in handling sensitive material, his decision not to file charges infuriated Republicans. Now, a federal judge has ordered the FBI to release more documents relating the email probe (via Washington Times):

Several hours before dawn on June 6, 1993, two Park Service police officers were patrolling the road next to Jacob Riis Park, a long stretch of beach on the Rockaway peninsula, in Queens, when they were startled by two Asian men flagging them down. As the officers got out of their car, they heard the sound of screams coming from the beach. The moon was full, and about a hundred yards offshore the officers saw a hundred-and-fifty-foot tramp steamer that had run aground. The ship's deck was crowded with people, and, as the officers watched, men and women jumped over the side, falling twenty feet into the surging waves below. Dozens of figures bobbed in the water, some managing to clamber ashore, others flailing wildly, apparently unable to swim. The officers radioed for backup. The ship's name, stencilled in white block letters on the bow, was the Golden Venture. Its cargo was nearly three hundred illegal Chinese emigrants. Before reaching the Rockaways, the ship had sailed some seventeen thousand miles, from Thailand to Kenya, around the Cape of Good Hope, then across the Atlantic to New York. The passengers—mostly adults, but a few children—were emaciated. They had been confined in the ship's hold for months, subsisting on rice, peanuts, and purified salt water. It had been uncomfortably hot, and many passengers wore only underwear; when they hit the water, which was fifty-three degrees, some went into cardiac arrest. One Coast Guard officer who performed CPR on two men onshore recalled, "I could feel the gristle of their bodies, the cartilage. They walked up out of the water, collapsed on the beach, and died." Six bodies were recovered from the surf; four others were found later. By dawn, news helicopters were capturing live footage of the disaster. The Golden Venture accident was not an isolated incident: in the preceding year, more than a dozen ships had dropped human cargo from China on American shores. In April, a ship called the Mermaid 1, carrying two hundred and thirty-seven illegal Chinese, had been intercepted by the Coast Guard near the Bahamas. In May, the Pai Sheng had slipped beneath the Golden Gate Bridge at night, depositing two hundred and fifty passengers on a San Francisco pier. An internal Department of Justice report declared an "immigration emergency"; the San Francisco Chronicle heralded a " SMUGGLER SHIP INVASION ." Several miles from the beach, in a small shop at 47 East Broadway, in Manhattan's Chinatown, a middle-aged woman named Cheng Chui Ping watched the story unfold on television. Short and stout, with cropped black hair, wide-set dark eyes, and a hangdog expression, she was known in the neighborhood as Ping Jia—Sister Ping. Her gruff demeanor and simple clothes gave her the appearance of a Chinese peasant; she had little formal education, spoke almost no English, and spent most of her waking hours managing the shop, which sold clothes and goods from China, and a restaurant in the basement. But Sister Ping was also an extraordinarily wealthy businesswoman who owned the restaurant and the shop, as well as the building that housed them. She was what the Chinese call a shetou, or "snakehead"—an underworld entrepreneur who charges tens of thousands of dollars to shepherd undocumented migrants from one country to another. She helped purchase the Golden Venture, and two of its passengers owed her fees. One of them had died. Last summer, twelve years after the Golden Venture ran aground, Sister Ping—now fifty-six, and a grandmother—was tried in a federal courtroom in New York City. She became the twenty-third person to be convicted in connection with the voyage. Described by the authorities as "the mother of all snakeheads," she was charged with operating what prosecutors called "a conglomerate built upon misery and greed." Moving people illegally from one country to another requires an extensive network of international contacts and an ability to outwit immigration and law-enforcement officers. With a well-connected family, acute entrepreneurial instincts, and a callous, life-is-cheap attitude toward the poor migrants who were her customers, Sister Ping was well suited to the job. Working with associates in China, Hong Kong, Thailand, Belize, Kenya, South Africa, Guatemala, Mexico, and Canada, she helped create the China-to-Chinatown route in the early nineteen-eighties and ushered thousands of undocumented Chinese emigrants to America. According to the F.B.I., over the course of two decades she made some forty million dollars.

According to Deadline, the writer behind Guy Ritchie's upcoming King Arthur movies (Joby Harold) has written a gritty Robin Hood movie—not to be confused with the last gritty Robin Hood movie. Harold's script is titled Robin Hood: Origins, because of course it is, and the project is competing with two other movies about Robin Hood that are already in development. One is a "revisionist" version at Disney called Nottingham And Hood, and the other is the set-up for yet another Avengers-style universe at Sony that is hilariously/confusingly titled Hood.

Charges of murder, homicide, or manslaughter all incorporate a similar result to an action. These terms all revolve around the killing of a human being. That being said, the United States legal system distinguishes between such actions of violence based on the convicted individual's intent, situation, and the circumstances that precipitated the murderous action.

A Quickscope is a close quarters technique/tactic which was generally an expliot at first. It is utilized by many gamers in Close Proximity with another player to Frag them, aka kill them. It was born in 1999 in a PC FPS game that is still bery popular known as Counter-Strike. The tactic is now used by many other games including Halo, Gears of War, Day of Defeat, Battlefield, & Call of duty. Most players now that do this technique over use it and call out other players that do not use the tactic when sniping.Most Call of duty Quickscopers only use the sniper rifle for this tactic because they think they are famous over youtube, or that being an on a youtube channel with a number next to their name makes them notorious. Other fps gamers do this technique for fun or when they are under pressure i.e Clutching a game while using a sniper rifle the old traditional way. They do not overuse it they do not boast about them being better than others when doing it, they just play like any other normal gamer. Quickscoping should not be an excuse for gamers to think they are better and more skilled than other players just because they have a new style of sniping.

The Red Raven Espresso Parlor wants to clarify that all are welcome in our space. We do not attempt to discriminate. The intent of our 'ban' was to satirize the environment that the legislation created for the LGBTQ+ community by voting against SB 2279. Here at the Raven we have workers and patrons who are included in this community who are directly impacted by this stringent and detached ruling. We stand by these individuals, as they are our families and friends. Its time the legislation affirms what the majority believes to be a fair, human practice of non-discrimination. In short, these 56 individuals are still welcomed into our establishment; however, their action/non-action has impacted far more than 56 individuals. Our 'ban' ponders the question, "What if that discrimination were re-directed, and reversed?" All we can confirm is that, either way, it feels icky.

When you hear the word chemotherapy what immediately comes to mind? Cancer. Bald. Nausea. Vomiting. Infusions. Sterility. Bone Pain? Upon hearing that word, most people jump to the same conclusions, with the same general consensus on how chemo works, who receives it, and what side effects it has on the body. The truth is chemotherapy isn't only for cancer patients, and affects each patient differently depending on how it is used.

Colds and Flu During Pregnancy What if I catch a cold or flu during pregnancy? During the course of your pregnancy, it is possible that you may catch a cold or flu virus. Because your immune system is affected during pregnancy, your symptoms may persist longer than usual. Nasal stuffiness is very common in pregnancy because of hormonal effects on the nasal passages. If other cold symptoms are not present, you probably do not have a cold. What measures may help to make me feel more comfortable? If you should catch a cold or flu, the following measures may help to make you feel more comfortable: Increase your fluid intake to eight to 10 glasses of liquids per day. Water is important, of course, but juices, pop and both all provide extra fluids, as well as nutritional intake at a time when your appetite may be decreased.

Honolulu traffic has improved, according to INRIX, a firm which tracks traffic across the U.S. In 2013, Honolulu had the second-worst traffic in the nation, just behind Los Angeles. But, INRIX's 2015 data show Honolulu traffic is the 10th worst in the nation, just behind Atlanta. The report says Honolulu drivers wasted an average of 49 hours in traffic in 2015, compared with 60 hours in 2013. In 2014, when INRIX released a list of the worst traffic corridors in the U.S., it included only freeway locations in the urban core. Some communities in West Oahu regularly encounter some of the island's worst traffic even though they're generally not considered part of urban Honolulu.

Russia found itself in difficult circumstances during the 1921 famine. Eventually, American aid was accepted, but this humanitarian generosity was partly motivated by disturbing accounts of cannibalism among the starving and desperate. A relief agent cited a telegram that was received by the Geneva Bureau of the International Committee in 1921 making specific claims to cannibalism in the Orenburg district of Russia. Three cases were mentioned from a village named Tuliakovna A man named Tuhvatulla Hallin ate the corpse of his brother. 1

They've proven time and time again that few do shooters as well, or better. After all, Battlefield is loved by the shooter community for its vehicular combat, sprawling fields of war, and class based gameplay. It's a match made in heaven.
Devart has released an upgraded version of their SecureBridge component set for Firemonkey in Delphi 10 Seattle. SecureBridge is a set of SSH, SSL, and SFTP components which work on Android, IOS, OSX, and Windows. With SecureBridge you can create SSH, SSL, and SFTP clients and servers to protect your data transfers over insecure networks. The SSH functionality allows you to create an SSH tunnel where you can use your existing application to connect and send data through the SSH tunnel. The SSH tunnel handles the encryption at the TCP level so that you don't have to. You can also use the SSL components which operate at the application level. Support for Blowfish, AES128, AES192, AES256, Cast128, and TripleDES symmetric algorithms is included plus support for RSA and DSA asymmetric algorithms, and SHA1 and MD5 hashing algorithms. SecureBridge is a commercial component suite which utilizes industry standard encryption mechanisms. There are free trials available and the components should work with Appmethod and probably C++Builder.

A route has been developed for the synthesis of nuclear analogues of the penicillins and cephalosporins from heterocyclic α-amino-acids. The route is illustrated by the synthesis of (2R,6R,7S)-8-oxo-7-phenylacetamido-1-azabicyclo[4,2,0]octane-2-carboxylic acid (19) from pyridine-2-carboxylic acid. A key step in the synthesis involves the photolysis of a diazo-compound and stereoselective intramolecular insertion by the transient carbene intermediate, so generating the required fused β-lactam heterocyclic system.

There is an exception noted, as the above only applies to Microsoft-published games apparently:

Dallas, TX, November 10, 2015– Today, the Dallas City Council fast tracked and approved an aggressive and dangerous bathroom ordinance that allows men into women's bathroom. In a surprise move that involved the Council approving controversial language in a closed door meeting late last night, without public input, the Council approved the new and sweeping language today that is over 10 pages long. The language is strikingly similar to the same "gender identity" and "public accommodations" language contained in the defeated Houston law that relates to bathroom, locker rooms and shower rooms. The new Dallas ordinance is a threat to safety and freedom and allows the government to fine private small business owners $500.

Maybe you have watched a few episodes of Sherlock and see him use his "memory palace" to fight crime and are thinking to yourself "hey, I wish I could do that!" The good news is that Sherlock's memory palace technique is not science fiction or fantasy. It is an ancient technique that uses your ability to remember places in vivid detail to remember abstract things like sequences of numbers or words. A great way of getting your feet wet with this type of mnemonics is to learn how to memorize a deck of tarot cards.

Two male employees at Clovis High School have been arrested for separate sexual incidents with the same student. Clovis police arrested Matthew Pena and Dwayne Andrews in connection with the same investigation.Andrews was nearing the peak of his Fresno State football career on the day Reggie Bush ran past him on the way to a tight USC win back in November 2005. Nine years later, he was still involved in football as an assistant coach for Clovis High. But Clovis Unified police served him with personnel paperwork as his career came to an end at the Fresno County jail."Dwayne, do you want to say anything about what happened?" an Action News reporter asked him."I don't have any comments right now," Andrews said.Pena was a photography teacher at Clovis High. He was an assistant baseball coach and even worked for a time as the official scorekeeper at Fresno Grizzlies games. But the Pacific Coast League fired him last summer for performance related issues. And this week, his career at Clovis Unified also came to an end."Our school became aware of the possibility of a rumor that there might be an inappropriate relationship between a student and a staff member on late Wednesday," said district spokeswoman Kelly Avants.Investigators believe Pena was sexually involved with a student who was 17 at the time. School administrators handed over the probe to Clovis police and it expanded from just Pena to Andrews as well."They followed through," said Clovis Police Department spokeswoman Janet Stoll-Lee. "They got search warrants for each one of them. They went and arrested each one of the men."The men are facing the exact same charges with the same alleged victim, a senior who turned 18 in December. But police say the incidents were separate and Pena and Andrews were arrested at separate locations. Investigators also say they don't believe any crimes happened on campus. But the situation is unnerving for students and staff."Whenever you learn about something like this, it's heartbreaking," said Avants. "It's devastating to everyone involved."Police say they don't believe there are any other victims or suspects. Pena resigned from the school district Thursday.

At the end of December the New York Times and Foreign Policy published pieces on African Pentecostalism, deliverance, and the demonic. Co-authoring the Foreign Policy article, Jill Filipovic and Ty McCormick focused on the relationship between Pentecostalism, witchcraft, and traditional African religion in the small country of Malawi. For her part, Tanya Luhrmann offered some observations on the role of demons and deliverance in Ghanaian charismatic churches and attempted to compare it with general observations about evangelicalism derived from her study of the Vineyard Churches. Both articles discuss the role of the demonic among African Pentecostals.

I stopped getting the name brand of Hazelnut spread when I read the ingredients- mostly filler and junk. I looked for something pure and found it in Great Value Hazelnut spread. At first I was a little disappointed because it was runny compared to Nutella- then I realized it was just like hot fudge- now I get it all the time and put it on my ice cream- not to mention just plain ol' eating it right out of the jar with a spoon. I also use it as a dip for apples and bananas... and sometimes I mix nuts in it and peanut butter (pure), but I never use it on toast- why waste chocolate on bread? But sometimes I use it for filler in between cakes. Even though I don't taste much of the hazelnut flavor, I like Great Value Hazelnut much better because it tastes like real chocolate- like a liquid candy bar, good for all your chocolate needs.

CHENNAI: Ahead of the northeast monsoon, residents of Velachery want an abandoned and garbage-filled well on Gandhi Road to be used as a rainwater harvesting system to replenish groundwater.But first they'll have to drive home the point of the plan to officials who were blasé about the upkeep of the well, leading to its current state, and now show little enthusiasm for a proposal to put it to good use.The open well, more than 40 years old, was once a source of water for the neighbourhood and surrounding farmland. Over the years, as it developed into a residential and commercial locality and people received Metrowater connections or sunk borewell, the well became a dumping pit. Authorities turned a blind eye as it filled with empty beer bottles, plastic bags and other waste, and residents and shopkeepers chipped in to cover it with wire mesh."Since we do not draw water from here, the authorities could make use of it for rainwater harvesting," Velachery-Guindy People's Welfare Association secretary V S Lingaperumal said.What is peculiar is that the well cannot possibly remain unnoticed by any local officer: It is right opposite the local ward councillor's office and a few metres away from the corporation office in the locality. And yet the corporation, which is in charge of rainwater harvesting in the city, has been lukewarm to the suggestion of the residents and Metrowater, which was in charge of maintaining the well, has washed its hands off it, with one official denying that the utility had anything to do with the well."Rainwater harvesting is one of the government's priorities so it will be done, if possible," said the local ward councillor, who has been camping in Bangalore since the day former chief minister was convicted in the disproportionate assets case. "I will come back and look into the matter.""The corporation and Metrowater don't practice what they preach residents," says Ram Shankar of Swaran (Save Water And Recharge Aquifers Network), a citizen's advocacy network lobbying with government to harvest water in public and private places. "The corporation should make the effort to harvesting rainwater from the well because it is a public site."Several experts have suggested that rainwater pools and wells be used to recharge the groundwater as opposed to building storm water drains that primarily let rainwater into the sea.Rain Centre director Sekhar Raghavan says the current rainwater harvesting systems are unlikely to last for more than a couple of years because they are likely to get clogged with silt. He suggests that the authorities create 'recharging wells' or 'baby wells' within the city that will collect rainwater and allow it to percolate into the ground.

One of the oddest pieces hitting my e-mail box in the last few days is regarding an analysis of homeownership and the number of Americans that supposedly own their homes free and clear. The slant is odd because Americans are massively in debt with mortgages and more have gone into deep debt with FHA insured loans that require only 3.5 percent down. These loans went from a tiny portion of the market to a dominant force over the last five years. The research starts out by pointing out that nearly 30 percent of Americans own their homes free and clear. Okay. But that isn't something new. In fact, in 2000 the rate was 30 percent and in 1990 and 1980 it was at 35 percent, in 1970 it was 39 percent, and in 1960 it was up to 42 percent. Of course none of this is listed in the analysis because hey, everyone owns their home free and clear right? In fact, the official figure is 29.3 percent so it actually is at the lowest on record when looking at data going back to 1960. The numbers are what they are but it is interesting how people viewed this as some kind of dynamic shift. Let us dig into the actual figures.

NEW DELHI: Is the Central Board of Secondary Education , the largest body for conducting school exams in India, inflating marks to safeguard its students from a "disadvantage" on the assumption that other boards are doing so too?The 'topper scam' in Bihar board and reports that up to 80 per cent of students so far admitted in DU's Shri Ram College of Commerce are from Tamil Nadu board, point to an unhealthy competition among various school boards to be 'liberal' in marking answer sheets and grant extra marks in the name of 'standardisation'.Consider this: CBSE gave as many as 16 extra marks in the class XII maths exam this year in the all-India set of papers and 15 marks in the Delhi set during the process of standardisation. In nine subjects, marks were 'standardised' up by more than 10 per cent. As a result of the standardisation, a student with 77 marks in mathematics may have ended up getting 93 marks on the result sheet. Similarly, a student of business studies who would have otherwise got 80 marks, may have finally got as much as 92 marks in the subject.Although CBSE doesn't bunch subjects according to streams, a candidate with physics, chemistry , mathematics and English core from Delhi region may have ended up with a cumulative of 42 'extra' marks, a spike of over 10 percentage points in best of four aggregate.Similarly, a student from the all-India pool with accountancy, business studies, economics, mathematics and English core combination could have a cumulative 49 'moderated' marks, again a nearly 10 percentage point gain overall.While moderation of marks has always existed to even out different levels of difficulty and other factors in an exam of such huge scale, sources said the exercise was conducted judiciously in the past. "It would never lead to an increase of more than five marks," said a former CBSE chairman.One of the reasons cited by CBSE sources for such huge jumps in marks was that students of other boards were being given both 'moderation' and 'grace' liberally , which according to former CBSE chiefs "is against the spirit of moderation".Officially , CBSE denied that its standardisation process was in part a response to the liberal marking by other boards.However, the minutes of the board's result committee meeting belies this claim. It says, "...members were of the opinion that the statistics shown will lead to CBSE's students in disadvantageous position in higher education in comparison to the students of other boards (like ICSE, UP board etc) who had given both moderation and grace liberally to their students." TOI has a copy of the minutes. Admitting to a growing competition among boards, former CBSE chairman Ashok Kumar Ganguly has called up the HRD ministry and the Council of Boards of School Education in India to intervene."There is a very unhealthy competition going on between the state and national boards. This should be nipped in the bud. We have seen what is happening in one of the colleges, where 75 per cent to 80 per cent of students are from a single board. This calls for a rationalization of marks before things worsen," Ganguly said.Also there seems to be inconsistencies in difficulty level between the question papers of the all-India and Delhi regions. Replying to TOI's queries, CBSE contradicted itself.To one query it said the exercise aimed to "level up the mean achievements in the set-wise performance of the candidates attributable to the difference in the difficulty level of different set of question papers in the multiple sets scheme." To another question, it replied, "There is no inconsistency in question paper design and difficulty level of the question papers administered under the All India Scheme, vis-a-vis the question papers administered anywhere."So, what explains the 11 moderated marks for the all India question paper in biology as against zero for Delhi region, or 12 marks for Delhi students in English (core) to zero for others, if the difficulty levels were the same? "Moderation should never exceed 5 per cent. Its specific purpose is in case of difference in difficulty level within different sets of question papers and not because other boards are giving high marks. Let CBSE put up on its website the moderated marks for each subject and the reasons," said Ganguly.Calling for strict guidelines for school boards, Ganguly added that in case there were no multiple sets of question papers, as is the case in many state boards, "there is no business of moderation".

taz447 said: I'm unsure if its been asked before but with this sheet exactly what would you need to do in order to add 2 additional skills to the sheet for the html code (html code I'm using is from GitHub as a base) What I'm trying to do is add 2 additional skills for making the sheet compatible with the adventures in middle earth conversion. In total their are 4 different skills i need to add. all of them are intelligence based so because of this I simply edited the html and translation to change arcana and religion to their respective 'new' skills, and i figured out how to reorganize them to maintain the sheet as an alphabetical list from top to bottom. The issue that I've encountered is that when trying to add in an additional skill into the html as a new item (shadow-lore) but i cant actually get the skill to display in the skill list. I'm not proficient enough in html editing to see what im missing but at request i can provide the html code i'm using to figure this out. Essentially, how do I go about introducing an entirely new skill to add to the base amount shown from 18 -> 20 Edit: I've been able to get the html to display the skill in the advanced options though not on the main page of the sheet at this point. Editing my Translation accordingly Also I apologize if this isnt the forum to be asking this but it's the only one I saw that made any sense Under the skills-container div you'll want to add a new skill div and just take an existing skill and everywhere the skill's name is, change it to the new name. Under the skill_bonus value= you'll want to change the base attribute it uses to fit the new skill. Under the skill_options div you'll want to give the "row skill" div the same treatment, copying it and replacing it with your new skill's name. Under the section you'll need to copy and paste the proficiency formula for your new skill

After the 2009-2010 season, long-time Duck captain Scott Niedermayer retired. And when potential top-5 pick Cam Fowler fell to the Ducks at 12 in the 2010 draft, it was one of those rare moments in hockey when a team can draft for present need, with the end of one career so clearly giving way to the beginning of another. Fowler, the then 18 year old defenseman, was often compared to Niedermayer for his skating ability and cited Niedermayer as his favorite NHL player. Fowler immediately moved into the Ducks lineup and into the Anaheim home of his personal instructor...Scott Niedermayer.

That and they would keep their status in the NA becoming a top 5 teir 1 NA team off the bat instead of having to requalify for the EU scene. Im pretty sure ESL and everyone else wouldn't just swap them to EU without penalties and requalifications required. And who the hell wants to start at the bottom again?

Abstract The reaction of cardiac tissue to acute injury involves interacting cascades of cellular and molecular responses that encompass inflammation, hormonal signaling, extracellular matrix remodeling, and compensatory adaptation of myocytes. Myocardial regeneration is observed in amphibians, whereas scar formation characterizes cardiac ventricular wound healing in a variety of mammalian injury models. We have previously shown that the MRL mouse strain has an extraordinary capacity to heal surgical wounds, a complex trait that maps to at least seven genetic loci. Here, we extend these studies to cardiac wounds and demonstrate that a severe transmural, cryogenically induced infarction of the right ventricle heals extensively within 60 days, with the restoration of normal myocardium and function. Scarring is markedly reduced in MRL mice compared with C57BL/6 mice, consistent with both the reduced hydroxyproline levels seen after injury and an elevated cardiomyocyte mitotic index of 10–20% for the MRL compared with 1–3% for the C57BL/6. The myocardial response to injury observed in these mice resembles the regenerative process seen in amphibians.

There has been great debate over the years about whether our tax system is fair and who is getting the short end of the stick. Some contest that the tax code has always favored the rich, while others maintain that virtually all Americans pay way too much in taxes, and some even think Americans don't pay enough tax. Of course, the definition of what is right and fair in this sense is somewhat subjective. There are some who feel that the tax code as it is written now offers some incentives for those who don't work for a living at all.

I agree; even though there's some hands-on implicit in the product being promoted, this seems to be largely advertising. It's the product that is central to the video, rather than the result, or the process of using it. Akin to making a video of how to assemble a product purchased at IKEA. Further support of the view that this is a commercial: the video (partially) aggressively obscures the right sidebar, and the default resolution is unusually (or unnecessarily) high.

I have several major scars on my torso. One is about the size of a silver dollar and is just under the bottom of my lowest left front rib (my brother used to say I had two belly buttons). Another is basically an arc-shaped fold of skin, about an inch long, just under the right scapula on my back. The largest scar begins just below and to the right of my right nipple and extends in a roughly straight line under my right armpit around to just above and to the left of the scar near my scapula. Anyone who has ever seen me without a shirt on has seen the scars. When I was younger, I used to enjoy telling tall tales about the origins of my scars. I told people it was a shark attack, a gang fight, or my personal favorite, "Dude, I got it in 'Nam."
The childhood obesity rate has leveled off, according to a new study by the CDC. "The prevalence of overweight and obesity among American schoolchildren has plateaued at about 32%," reports Time, and the magazine attributes the lack of obesity increase to national efforts to combat the problem, like fitness programs and healthy eating education. The CDC argues that more time and data collection is needed to truly prove that the obesity epidemic has halted in its tracks. Still, 32% is quite high, and an editorial published alongside the CDC study in the Journal of the American Medical Association points out, "Without substantial declines in prevalence, the public health toll of childhood obesity will continue to mount."

The Production Information you've all been waiting for~
Amongst the stat-head brain trust and regular commentariat here at EOTP this season there has been a re-occurring topic of discussion of Louis Leblanc's shots per game rate at the AHL level, as it was very high relative to his peers for a player whose surface AHL statistics were decent but unremarkable. This has lead to a question that, to the best of my knowledge, has never been asked by the internet advanced hockey stat community: What significance do AHL shot rates have for predicting NHL performance. The relative constancy of shot production rates and the transiency of shooting percentage has long been established at the NHL level. Likewise the question of how AHL scoring translates to the NHL has been fairly extensively covered, starting with Gabe Desjardins ' simple AHL to NHL equivalency (multiply AHL scoring by .44) to Robert Vollman's more extensive look at the factor of age in translation http://www.puckprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=1079, or refinements in splitting even strength from other scoring when making comparisons.

Hillary Clinton is in, and with her announcement the rest of the Democrats considering running for president in 2016 are out. In a manner reminiscent of the Republican Party of old, Democrats have ceded the nomination to Hillary Clinton. It is not exactly clear why this is the case. She clearly has a large following in the party and has a huge fundraising base, but that was true eight years ago as well. Perhaps it is because she lost a close race for the nomination last time that she is being handed the baton this time. Or perhaps the theory is that as the scorned candidate and cuckolded spouse she has suffered enough, that it is her turn. Whatever the reason, Hillary is off to a rocky start, and it could be a long year.

PRODUCER'S NOTE It's been one week since releasing our updated asset loader. This was a big change that impacted game stability a bit. We had to hotfix a few major bugs (see right below) but as of this patch we aim to be back to the pre 0.42.0 level of stability. So... we'd love to hear from you: how is the game running? Is performance still preventing you from enjoying the game? (Please include your platform specs and if you play on PC/OSX/Browser).

This release adds the MicroPython cross-compiler that can generate .mpy files (pre-compiled bytecode) which can be executed within any MicroPython runtime/VM. The ESP8266 port is also vastly improved thanks to a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign. This port now has an alternative event loop implementation to allow proper Berkeley sockets using lwIP built from source, and a greatly improved network module. Many extension modules are now enabled (ujson, ubinascii, uctypes, uhashlib, urandom, uheapq, ure, uzlib) and the machine module includes Timer, Pin, PWM, ADC, I2C, SPI, and basic UART. Bignums are supported, along with 30-bit precision floating point, and normal error messages. There is FatFS support and uos.dupterm. Many other improvements and bug fixes have been made to the core and other ports. The basic test suite can now run within a 16k heap. Inline assembler functions now support 4 arguments. The Unix port has the -i option to start the REPL after a script is finished. The stmhal port now exposes the flash and SD card as proper objects with the block protocol. There is support for generic STM32F439 boards, the NUCLEO-F411RE board, and targets to deploy via ST-LINK and OpenOCD. py core: - mpprint: fix sign extension when printf'ing %u, %x and %X - vm: fix popping of exception block in UNWIND_JUMP opcode - objstr: for str.format, add nested/computed fields support - objstr: for str.format, don't allocate on the heap for field name - extend native type-sig to use 4 bits, so uint is separate to ptr - mpz: complete implementation of mpz_{and,or,xor} for negative args - mpz: add commented-out mpz_pow3_inpl function, to compute (x**y)%z - viper: allow casting of Python integers to viper pointers - viper: allow uint as index to load/store, and give better error msg - objarray: implement "in" operator for bytearray - mpstate.h: fs_user_mount is now standard, reusable uPy functionality - asmx64: add helper macro for generating REX_[WRXB] bits from a reg64 - asmx64: support all 16 regs in reg to memory move instructions - emitnative: add check that RHS of viper store is of integral type - repl: check for an identifier char after the keyword - vm: add macros to hook into various points in the VM - parse: use m_renew_maybe to ensure that memory is shrunk in-place - malloc: provide a proper malloc-based implementation of realloc_ext - emitinlinethumb: use qstrs instead of char* for names of asm ops - add MICROPY_DYNAMIC_COMPILER option to config compiler at runtime - stackctrl: add mp_stack_set_top() to explicitly set stack top value - emitglue: get persistent bytecode working on Linux ARM platform - objboundmeth: allocate arg state on stack if heap alloc fails - use MP_SMALL_INT_POSITIVE_MASK to check if uint fits in a small int - fix passing of some wide int types to printf varg format list - objarray: fix array slice assignment when array is reallocated - formatfloat: fix buffer overflow when formatting tiny numbers - objfun: allow inline-asm functions to be called with 4 arguments - frozenmod: allow port to override lexer to use for frozen modules - parse: don't allocate an extra parse node for power exponent - parse: when looking up consts, check they exist before checking type - stream: add mp_stream_writeall() helper function - stream: fix object vs ptr usecase in mp_stream_writeall() - modio: initial implementation of io.BufferedWriter class - modio: implement io.BufferedWriter.flush() - modio: io.BufferedWriter: describe flushing policy - formatfloat: fix case of float format where leading digit was "10" - formatfloat: fix further cases of buffer overflow in formatting - parsenum: use pow function to apply exponent to decimal number - ringbuf.h: add reusable ring buffer class - map: prevent map resize failure from destroying map - move stream-related declarations from obj.h to stream.h - combine continuous block of emit steps into with_cleanup emit call - implement basic with support in native emitter - objarray: fix array.append so it doesn't extend if append fails - stream: add bigger inventory of stream ioctl

"Ask yourself if you're covering up something that should be addressed separately," says Crocker. He recommends getting in touch with the original owners or the builder who installed the brick, whenever possible, to uncover any problems that might arise. "You have to be very careful when you're changing the exterior makeup of a wall," says Crocker.Moisture is a concern that's usually apparent right off the bat. Water can enter brick through brick pores, incomplete mortar joints, sills, copings and other gaps. Make sure your brick is completely dry before you paint it — the risk of long-term or immediate damage is less likely.The natural chemical property of bricks may affect your paint's durability as well. According to the Brick Industry Association, most bricks are neutral, but mortar often has a basic alkalinity. Paint products can be affected, so alkaline-resistant primer is usually recommended."Efflorescence" is a big word for that annoying white residue that often appears on older brick walls. This residue is made up of deposits of water-soluble salt buildup, often from moisture inside the brick. Remove the efflorescence with water and a stiff brush before painting your brick, and wait to see if it returns. If it does, you may have a bigger problem on your hands that requires professional help.

One day not long ago a 27-year-old woman was brought to the Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, sleepy and confused. Fani Andelman, a neuropsychologist at the center, and colleagues gave the woman a battery of psychological tests to judge her state of mind. At first the woman seemed fine. She could see and speak clearly. She could understand the meaning of words and recall the faces of famous people. She could even solve logic puzzles, including a complex test that required her to plan several steps ahead. But her memory had holes. She could still remember recent events outside her own life, and she could tell Andelman details of her life up to 2004. Beyond that point, however, her autobiography was in tatters. The more doctors probed her so-called episodic memory—the sequential recollection of personal events from the past—the more upset she became. As for envisioning her personal future, that was a lost cause. Asked what she thought she might be doing anytime beyond the next day, she couldn't tell them anything at all.

My boyfriend (BF) had two pairs of jeans one had a perfect zipper but was torn; the other had a broken zipper and was otherwise perfect. He had asked me to take both jeans and make one. Rather than make a video tutorial which would take more time that I at the moment I decided to make a blog entry. The following picture is from the jean that is missing the tooth, a second tooth broke alter on. But you can see that it needed replacing. This next picture I'm removing the stitches of the waistband. If this is your first time replacing a zipper on jean or any other garment take notes on how its constructed or better yet take a few pictures before you start ripping seams. Once the waistband seams were removed I started on removing the zipper on the left side of the pants. I also had to remove some stitches that were holding the zipper in place at the crotch seam. Next I moved to removing the zipper on the right side of the pants. After doing this to both pants, which took some time, I had my zipper and the broken one. Here you can see the missing teeth on the lower zipper. These zippers didn't have a "top stops" so when I closed it the pull tab take flying off the teeth. I was left with the pull tab in my hand and surprised look on my face almost comical. It took forever to try to get the pull tab back on the zipper teeth. So keep in my don't close the zipper all the way and secure it with a safety pin. Now I can finally attach the zipper to the pants. First I hand stitched the zipper in place, serged the edges that needed it. Then using my new Juki sewing machine I top stitched the zipper. Since this machine doesn't allow for 2 needle for the top stitching. I had to sew it twice and make sure to be careful about the distance between both. I started off by attaching the right side of the zipper first then the left side I attached the zipper to the under flap and then top stitched it. Finally I top stitched the crotch seam and the little notch. I'm not sure what its called so I use "little notch". It the zigzag stitch that holds down the inner flap to the jeans. After finishing the top stitching I moved on to attach the waistband, that was the easiest part. My BF didn't care that I couldn't match the thread color, so you'll be able to see my top stitching.

Review of 5190S Review by DAVID
It's rare that you see a player who is miles ahead of everyone else at their position, but that is exactly how I feel about Ed Oliver @Edoliver_11 ‏. He is the best defensive tackle prospect that I have seen and best to come along, since Ndamukong Suh at Nebraska. That in itself is extremely high praise for such a young player. When you watch his tape, you can see this praise is very much warranted and deserved. If you haven't seen this kid play, You owe it to yourself to put on his game tapes and just enjoy watching him go to work. The sophomore is listed at 6'3" 290 lbs and is a human wrecking ball. Oliver is as highly decorated as any college player can be. Just look at the list of accolades below:

Despite the era's prudish, repressed reputation, the Victorians loved a good craze — the weirder, the better. Well-to-do men and women alike found themselves gripped by fashionable momentary obsessions with novelties, from blue-and-white porcelain to orchids to roller skates to spiritual seances. When the late 1870s brought the so-called "Ordinary" or penny farthing bicycle (the epitome of an old-timey bike, with a front wheel many times larger than the rear) into the public eye, the comical-looking contraption was a sensation.Bicycle mania swept the nation, and the advent of the more manageable "Safety" bicycle — named for its relative safety compared to the high-wheeled penny farthing — meant that even women could get in on the fun. While today it seems completely natural to hop a bike and hit the road, the advent of the bicycle had a hugely liberating (and controversial) impact on women's lives; for the first time, there was a way for them to leave their houses and embrace their own autonomy without facing social suicide.A woman born during the Victorian era had precious few options. Middle- and upper-class ladies were expected to marry, give birth to babies (preferably boys), entertain guests, and keep a respectable household — that's it. A proper lady's place was in the home, where she whiled away her days strapped into a suffocating corset and cumbersome hoop skirt, minding the servants, popping out children, and serving as an ornamental object for her (hopefully rich) husband to either cossett or ignore as it suited him. Women weren't meant to exercise their bodies or their minds, which led to generations of frail creatures whose lives were governed by fainting spells and striving for an arsenic-white complexion, no matter how much they secretly yearned to write or debate or explore.Those who ran afoul of these social conventions ran considerable risk of ostracization and/or "spinsterhood" — a fate which, back then, meant a life of poverty and loneliness. However, once the bicycle entered the picture, all of these bored, idle housewives and daughters were suddenly given a safe, respectable route out of their velvet prisons. They grabbed those handlebars like drowning people straining towards life preservers. As an 1896 issue of Munsey's Magazine explained, "To men, the bicycle...was merely a new toy, another machine added to the long list of devices they knew in their work and play. To women, it was a steed upon which they rode into a new world."The notion of women freely riding around town on wheels dismayed plenty of staunch traditionalists, especially when those women discovered bloomers. Bloomers (also referred to as "Turkish dress") were loose pantaloons worn beneath a shortened skirt that soon replaced the customary heavy layers of petticoats and whalebone corsets initially worn by lady cyclists. The "rational dress" movement that had blossomed during the first wave of feminism found renewed traction thanks to the bicycle; its advocates campaigned for less-restrictive garments, moving to abolish the hated tight-laced corset and normalize simpler attire for athletic use. The long skirts and constricting undergarments Victorian ladies were required to wear were impractical, uncomfortable, and dangerous even when sitting, let alone cycling; comfortable, bifurcated bloomers were the obvious answer, and they became immensely popular.

2016 has been a busy year for Capcom, especially in the West. First, Street Fighter V hit store shelves worldwide on Feb 16th and has, according to news from October, has been struggling to sell well since. Then Monster Hunter Generations reached North American audiences during the summer. Since then, a brand new sequel to Generations has been announced. But according to a story posted by Esuteru, Capcom is already looking into long-term plans for their franchises, included a major focus beyond Japan for Monster Hunter.
Mark Gatiss's love for the Ice Warriors is no secret. Not only did he pen their return to the series back in 2013's Cold War, but he has frequently praised them in interviews across the years. If one was to hazard a guess as to what Gatiss's favourite Doctor Who monster was, the Ice Warriors would be a safe bet. So it comes as no surprise that for the episode Gatiss is treating as his final ever episode on the show (on the off chance he doesn't get invited back by Chris Chibnall) features them in a large capacity and, amusingly, features a cameo very few "modern" Doctor Who fans are likely to get. How many people know who the Alpha Centauri is and have seen the episodes it appeared in? Gatiss also was intent to deliver something Doctor Who fans have never seen before; the Ice Warriors on Mars. Yes, despite them being native to the red planet, the Martian warriors have never actually appeared in an episode set there. So how does Empress of Mars fare, being both Gatiss's potential final episode and as a grand return for the Ice Warriors?

After banning firecrackers on Diwali, Supreme Court judges reciprocated the decision to them also and ordered themselves to stop using personal vehicles and cars. Judges decided to use bicycles immediately which will help them reduce pollution substantially.

FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. — A large-scale human rights violation is occurring in the United States, and there is a dearth of news coverage on the issue. Nuclear contamination from abandoned uranium mines is rampant across the Navajo Nation's 27,000 square miles of land, throughout Utah, New Mexico and Arizona. This situation has left thousands of people without access to safe drinking water, according to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In response, a community of artists is raising awareness about the problem through a street art project and a gallery exhibition.

Desert plants have found a place in modern home and garden design. There are many plants in the desert that can survive in a xeriscape garden or even in a glass terrarium. The term xeriscape is derived from the Greek word xeros, which means "dry," and is a form of landscaping that conserves water through the use of native plants. Thus, desert plants have become popular for landscaping because they are easy to take care of due to their drought-tolerant capabilities.
Rand Paul begins his Time op-ed about Ferguson with a good point: One concrete way politicians can lessen discrimination in the criminal justice system is by reforming policing practices and the war on drugs. "Michael Brown's death and the suffocation of Eric Garner in New York for selling untaxed cigarettes indicate something is wrong with criminal justice in America," the Kentucky senator writes. "The War on Drugs has created a culture of violence and put police in a nearly impossible situation."

Hello there! Congratulations on taking a giant leap forward for your health, the planet, and the animals! As you begin your journey, there are a lot of new things to learn, and many questions pertaining to veganism.

But veganism has opened up worlds of culinary opportunities, and I have never felt better physically or mentally in my life.
The aim of this investigation was to assess the effects of 6 wk of eicosapentanoic acid (EPA) and docosahexanoic acid (DHA) supplementation on resting and exercise-induced lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in judoists. Subjects were randomly assigned to receive a placebo or a capsule of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs; 600 mg EPA and 400 mg DHA). Blood samples were collected in preexercise and postexercise conditions (judo-training session), both before and after the supplementation period. The following parameters were analyzed: α-tocopherol, retinol, lag phase , maximum rate of oxidation (Rmax) during the propagating chain reaction, maximum amount of conjugated dienes (CDmax) accumulated after the propagation phase, nitric oxide (NO) and malondyaldehide (MDA) concentrations, salivary glutathione peroxidase activity, and the lipid profile. Dietary data were collected using a 7-day dietary record. A significant interaction effect between supplementation and time (p < .01) on triglycerides was noted, with values significantly lower in the n-3 long-chain-PUFA (LCPUFA) group after supplementation than in the placebo group. Significant interaction effects between supplementation and time on resting MDA concentrations and Rmax were found (p = .03 and p = .04, respectively), with elevated values in the n-3 LCPUFA group after supplementation and no change in the placebo group's levels. The authors observed a significantly greater NO and oxidative-stress increase with exercise (MDA, Rmax, CDmax, and NO) in the n-3 LCPUFA group than with placebo. No main or interaction effects were found for retinol and α-tocopherol. These results indicate that supplementation with n-3 LCPUFAs significantly increased oxidative stress at rest and after a judo-training session.
Social being conditions consciousness, so they say. What's going on in your life, for good or ill, will impact on your thinking and opinions about it. When people live out similar circumstances, their views tend to have a certain homogeneity on particular issues. Take our beloved ruling class, for instance. Wherever they sit on the political spectrum they have the not-at-all-surprising tendency to think British capitalism is fundamentally fine. That these views are entirely congruent with their being the beneficiaries of this set up is not coincidental, and is simultaneously the great unsaid and unsayable of British politics. The collective fear gripping these people of Jeremy Corbyn is an anxiety that some of them are set to lose out, and the Labour leader is opening a Pandora's Box of demands set on eroding their power and privilege further. Rational to worry, yes. But they cannot say this. Which is why you have Toby Young likening Momentum to Britain First, and assorted hyperbole about gulaging Tories. We find this refracted inside the Labour Party as well. For example, we find moaning in The Sunday Times NEC hopeful Gurinder Singh Josan, who argues , totally disingenuously, "many members are only concerned with the question 'do they support Momentum?' This coupled with the fact the influx of new members is disproportionately white and middle class, has resulted in the influence of minority groups being diluted." There are a few things worth noting here. First, Labour is more a working class organisation than it ever was when Gurinder's Progress and Labour First chums were in charge. Then we were told to forget about the working class as times had a-changed. Our traditional conceptions were out of date so we had to target all those white-collared folks. Now the boot's on the other foot, cloth caps, whippets and "real concerns about immigration" are clung to like the most pathetic fetish. Second, as the majority of Labour's councillors are white and male, highlighting the odd gay or black councillor who finds themselves deselected for political reasons while insinuating, non-too-subtly, that Momentum are a bunch of homophobes and racists says more about Gurinder and chums than anything else. Third, if getting more women and minorities into politics regardless of politics is the game, we're still waiting for Progress to undertake an auto-critique for backing David Miliband over Diane Abbott in 2010. Another example is Nick Cohen's most recent regurgitation . And the up chuck metaphor is spot on, because there's nothing here our Nick hasn't made a meal out of before. In this universe, we are expected to believe the doddery and dozy Communist Party of Britain is a lean, mean, liquidatin' machine, and Corbyn's Britain promises something out of 1930s Stalinism. He simultaneously and somewhat confusingly casts our would-be totalitarians as "hyper-liberal"(!), and attacks the young left for its humourlessness and suspicion of complexity. A more open and shut case of projection is seldom found. And there was dear old Roy Hattersley's feeble bombardment last week. Get a clue, Roy, and make sure you've not loaded duds before firing. Published hours before Survation gave Labour an eight point lead, Roy argued the party was in its greatest ever danger. The hard left are steering it onto the rocks and horror of horrors, they plan on changing the party's rules. Like so many others who know everything and understand nothing, Roy observes Labour's modest poll leads and confidently claims Labour should be 20 points in the lead. As someone who twice went up against a Tory government presiding over mass unemployment and lost, he really should know better: politics is never simple . What do all these adventures in right wing factionalising have in common? It's their intellectual vacuity, a studied refusal to look the real world in the face and learn from it. A dishonest argument here, a demonstrable untruth there, these are the Labourist iterations of the shades summoned by what passes for Tory thought. But where does this utter aversion to thinking and indifference to looking stupid come from? It's part historical, and part conjunctural. As argued on many occasions on this blog, at its origin the Labour Party was (and remains) a proletarian party. Banish the images of the working class you find hanging around today's Progress Magazine editorials and look at the coalition of interests the Labour Representation Committee brought together: the massed battalions organised labour via the trade unions, and the professional middle class organised through socialist societies and interest groups. A disparate constituency on the one hand, but on the other a condensation of millions of people with one thing in common: the necessity of selling their labour in return for a wage or a salary. The sorts of tensions Lenin and co wrote about in Western Labour and Social Democratic policies which they put down to the super profits of imperialism shared out among labour aristocracies who, in their turn, kept the rest of the movement

ClockworkMod Custom Recovery has been updated to version 6.0.5.1.4. The new version has added support for EXT4 formatted USB drives. This is very useful for those who have expanded their internal storage with an EXT4 external USB drive as it allows them to access the expanded storage while in ClockworkMod. More importantly, as of this version of CLockworkMod, kernel patching has now been removed. This means that your Fire TV must have an unlocked bootloader in order to install this version (and likely future versions) of ClockworkMod. You should follow my guide to unlock your bootloader before you proceed to installing this ClockworkMod update. If you're installing ClockworkMod for the first time, you also first need to unlock your bootloader. Note that version 6.0.5.1.4 of ClockworkMod was initially released without the utility that allows remote control via ADB. An updated version, 6.0.5.1.4a, has been released since which re-includes the utility. You should skip the initial version 6.0.5.1.4 and just install the updated version 6.0.5.1.4a.

Sir Michael Barber, Pearson's chief educational officer, actually became a British knight in 2005 for his role in leading marketplace "educational reform" in Great Britain. I suspect if he were good in math they would have made him a count. Barber apparently can't decide whether Pearson is leading a global Renaissance (rebirth) in education, a global revolution, or both. But in either case he believes that globalisation (he spells it like a Brit) and technology will direct the changes and we mere peasants have no choice but to go along. Sir Mike constantly writes and speaks about efficacy, the ability to produce a desired or intended result. But as you look at what is happening with Pearson and education, you see very little efficacy. Pearson's only intended result is to make more and more money. That is why so many people are pissed at Pearson and fighting back against Common Core and Pearson PARCC exams.

I fully supported Labour's three-line whip to vote to trigger article 50 last week. Our union campaigned vigorously to remain in the European Union but we respect the result of the referendum. Had Labour voted to block article 50 at the first hurdle, it's effect would have been to give millions of voters the proverbial two fingers. Let's face it, many people voted leave because they felt our political class no longer speaks for them. A vote against starting the process to trigger article 50 would have gone a long way to proving their point. However, no one voted for "Brexit at any cost, which is why the amendments tabled by Labour's front bench are warmly welcome".

Expected goals are a difficult metric. Apart from the huge amount of work in takes to create an xG-model, once you've got one it's hard to tell if it's any good. Most people try to check this by checking if their xG totals for entire seasons are similar to the actual goal totals, mostly using R2. In my latest blog I tried to explain why I think this is a very poor way to evaluate your xG-model. I also hinted at a better way to evaluate an xG-model, something I will explain and apply today. First I'll explain my methodology and afterwards I'll apply it to evaluate different xG-models, including a few of the most prominent ones in the community like Michael Caley's and 11tegen11's model. Are those models really better than other models? And how close to being perfect are they? If you're only interested in the results please skip the next paragraph.

That repeatability is a huge part of what makes physics effective.

Erection is the most apparent sign of sexual desire. It is the process of hardening the penis owing to a rush of blood into its blood vessels. As a result it gets larger and sticks out from the body. Hardened penis is capable of penetrating into woman's reproductive organs and sexual intercourse is performed. To the parents of young boys the issue of erection may seem a long way off. But in fact, sexual development begins at quite an early age. All children – from babies to primary school pupils – grow both physically and sexually in their own ways.

Halo Wars 2, in many ways, picks up right where the original Halo Wars left off. The story jumps forward through slip space 28 years and straight into the current post-Halo 5 timeline, still following The Spirit of Fire and its crew (insert speculation about Halo 6's plot here). Just as with Halo Wars and the mainline Halo series, the cinematics, created by Blur Studio, are top-notch, as is the overall production value. However, the latest installment from 343 Studios and Creative Assembly suffers from the same dumbed-down strategic formula and general lack of content that its predecessor did, and instead finds itself serving as a fresh reminder of why RTS games don't belong on consoles.

MUMBAI: The Maharashtra government is set to take concrete steps in the next 15 days to roll out what state officials say could well become the 'torch bearer' of the ' Make in India ' initiative -the first 20-seater commercial passenger plane built in India.The state will allot 46-acres of land in Palghar to Amol Yadav (40), a Jet Airways pilot, for building 20-seater commercial planes. No company in India has manufactured such an aircraft in India yet.Yadav had created quite a stir during the Make in India week held in Mumbai in February this year with his six-seater passenger plane TAC-003, which he built along with his family and friends on the terrace of his flat in Charkop, Mumbai.Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis , when contacted, said that "his government will support Yadav" for the venture. Government officials said that Fadnavis has told them "to make sure that all necessary support is provided within the legal framework". Yadav told ET that the price of his 20-seater planes will be significantly less than similar aircraft imported from abroad, and can "revolutionize air travel" in the country."These aircraft can fly between smaller cities with tickets priced at less than Rs 2,000, which will improve air connectivity and boost tourism," said Yadav. He is in talks with aircraft engine manufacturer Pratt & Whitney to supply engines for his aircraft. The first two prototype 20seater planes will be rolled out by the end of next year.Yadav had met the Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis and other officials after the Make in India week, and had presented a plan to manufacture aircraft in the country.Officials in the state government, who had studied Yadav's proposal, firmly believe that the plan can work and are ready to back him all the way ."Maharashtra and India could be on the world aviation map once he starts manufacturing these aircraft. We could soon be looking at exporting them as they can be more economical than the imported ones," said a Maharashtra government official, who didn't wish to be identified.The state is not just allocating Yadav land but is also trying to help him get his startup capital by talking to a few banks. A top state government official said that they would also be exploring whether Small Industries Development Bank of India ( SIDBI ) can extend a loan for this venture.

CHENNAI: StayZilla Co-Founder Yogendra Vasupal was today granted bail by the Madras High Court on a condition that he should deposit Rs 40 lakh with the court to establish bonafide intentions.Judge S Baskaran, while granting bail, termed the case as "purely a dispute between two businessmen."Interestingly, the counsellor for Jigsaw had pushed for mediation as a means to settle the issue but Vasupal's counsellors told the court firmly their client was not up for mediation.The money deposit was necessitated after counsellors for Jigsaw raised questions over Vasupal's intentions to settle dues. "They closed StayZilla, which made us apprehensive," the counsellor said. The judge has given Vasupal one week's time for the deposit.A counsellor for Vasupal said the money will not go to the de-facto complainant(Jigsaw) until the case is complete.Jigsaw solutions, an advertising vendor, had lodged a complaint of dues worth Rs 1.69 crore owed by StayZilla for a period between March and May 2016. The company, which had raised $13 million in May, had filed up on February this year, promising a reboot.The police filed a case under Section 420, 406, and 506(I) on March 13 and arrested Vasupal in Chennai on the IT corridor the next day.Vasupal's arrest and the quick action by the police polarised observers, with some claiming the episode is rattling the start-up ecosystem while others saying it is just a one-off incident.Vasupal had posted two blog posts, one making a fervent plea for help and other asserting that he had no intentions to cheat as made out by Jigsaw.

Caught on camera: Michael Adebolajo spoke to bystanders. Photo: ITV The violent murder of Drummer Rigby was the culmination of a 12-year period of radicalisation for Adebolajo, a former Christian, which began when he was a teenager and involved several run-ins with the police, including a prison sentence for assault. Adebolajo, 28, is the son of devout Christian Nigerian immigrants, Anthony and Ibitoye Adebolajo, who settled in Romford, east London, where Michael and his three siblings were born. Adebolajo went to the local Marshalls Park School and Havering Sixth Form College, where he first became interested in Islam at the age of 16 or 17. One school friend said: "His parents were extremely strict. They were really devout Christians. They did not let Michael or his brother and sister do anything when they were younger.
I emerged from the fourth season of the BBC's once awesome Sherlock in a kind of incoherent rage at what successful writers get away with when they are, apparently, deemed too big to fail. I'm not the only one, of course. There was a nice skewering of the show's degeneration from cerebral mystery to James Bond-lite action film in the Guardian and the program's principal show runner, Steven Moffat, has been drawing feminist flak since season two, so rather than go after elements of the show itself (and spoiling it for those who haven't seen it in the process) I want to step back from Sherlock and focus on a troubling element I've seen in a lot of recent storytelling: the disastrous pursuit of surprise.

Papadopoulos Is Connected to Fusion Dossier: Was in Contact with Sergie Millian, the Steele Source for the Dossier
As a builder constructing townhouses, commercial buildings, and the occasional slab-on-grade (SOG) house in frigid Nebraska, I always thought it silly to dig footings half as deep as a full basement when the point of SOG construction was to spend less on foundations. A basement seemed the better value, to me, given that only token cost savings came with a slab ... until one year, while attending the National Association of Home Builders (NAHB) International Builders' Show, I heard a lecture on a new (at least for me) approach to constructing slabs in northern climates that did not require footings to extend below the frost line. I immediately perked up and listened closely; it sounded like a good cost-saving measure.

This article is one in a series of studies on message theology - you are currently on the article that is in bold:
Starting with a knee cut guard pass, drive your knee all the way to the ground, and then backstep to the opposite side of your partner's body. Be sure that when you step back, you don't simply swing your leg wide, but instead, take a much shorter, tighter step back, and then drive your knee through the space underneath your partner's leg. Assuming you were cutting your right knee across, it is your left knee that is poking through this space. Hug your partner's knee close to your body, making sure your knee is all the way through, isolating their leg, and finishing with you in the over/under position, attacking their left leg with the inverted heel hook. Lean to your right hip to bend their knee at 90 degrees, and get your heel hook grip (always go palm to palm here, and always use only the blade of your wrist for the finish, ensuring that you are hooking their heel, not sliding off). If your partner rolls through, you have a sort of double whammy: the kneebar during the transition, and then the 50/50 inverted heel hook finish when they roll all the way through past the kneebar.

Sherrod Brown, and Rep. Jim Renacci, who is running against Rep. Betty Sutton in a newly configured House district. Ohio newspapers have leapt on the report, getting Mandel's campaign to acknowledge the investigation (they had not returned my calls) and running follow-up stories on at least three front pages in Ohio today (the Toledo Blade, Akron Beacon-Journal, and Dayton Daily News.)

Although acquisition of anti-pertussis antibodies by the newborn via placental transfer has been demonstrated, a subsequent recrudescence of pertussis infection is often observed, particularly in infants. The present study investigated the passive transfer of anti-pertussis IgG and IgA antibodies to term newborns and their ability to neutralize bacterial pathogenicity in an in vivo experimental model using mice intracerebrally challenged with viable Bordetella pertussis. Forty paired samples of maternal/umbilical cord sera and colostrum were obtained. Anti-pertussis antibodies were analysed by immunoenzymatic assay and by Immunoblotting. Antibody neutralizing ability was assessed through intracerebral B. pertussis challenges in mice. Anti-pertussis IgG titres were equivalent in both maternal and newborn sera (medians = 1:225 and 1:265), with a transfer rate of 118%. The colostrum samples had variable specific IgA titres (median = 1:74). The immunoblotting assays demonstrated identical recognition profiles of paired maternal and newborn serum pools but different bacterial recognition intensities by colostrum pools. In the animal model, significant differences were always observed when the serum and colostrum samples and pools were compared with the positive control (P < 0.05). Unlike samples with lower anti-pertussis titres, samples with high titres showed protective capacities above 50%. Pertussis-absorbed serum and colostrum pools protected 30% of mice and purified IgG antibodies protected 65%. Both pooled and single-sample protective abilities were correlated with antibody titres (P < 0.01). Our data demonstrated the effectiveness of anti-pertussis antibodies in bacterial pathogenesis neutralization, emphasizing the importance of placental transfer and breast-feeding in protecting infants against respiratory infections caused by Bordetella pertussis.

A cell carrying an RNA-targeted Cas9 system that reveals beta-actin mRNA distribution in the cytoplasm. Credit: UC San Diego Health The genetic code stored in DNA determines everything from the color of our eyes to our susceptibility to disease. This has motivated scientists to sequence the human genome and develop ways to alter the genetic code, but many diseases are linked to a different fundamental molecule: RNA. As the intermediary genetic material that carries the genetic code from the cell's nucleus, scientists have long sought an efficient method for targeting RNA in living cells. Researchers at University of California, San Diego School of Medicine have now achieved this by applying the popular DNA-editing technique CRISPR-Cas9 to RNA.

Rocket engine flight certification ground testing requires high-speed video recording that can capture essential information for NASA. This need is particularly true in the event of a mishap, when investigations into the underlying cause ensue. The current operational imaging system at SSC has poor resolution and records to VHS tapes that are no longer commercially available. The test bed project developed a high-speed High Dynamic Range (HDR) imaging capability using two boresighted cameras to demonstrate what is achievable with a single camera. This project will also lay the foundation for other Rocket Propulsion Test high-speed recording initiatives as well as rocket engine and launch initiatives.

We suggest you consider adopting a puppy (or an adult) from a shelter or rescue group before buying one. But if your heart's set on a purebred puppy, the first step is to find a breeder who knows what she's doing. Unlike pet stores and unscrupulous breeders, good breeders are careful to breed only healthy dogs with good temperaments. This means that any puppy you get from them has a better chance of turning out to be a good family pet. They also know how to raise their puppies in a way that prepares them for life as a family dog.

JAMES DILL, Clerk of the Southern District ofJVew.rork Upwards of forty years have elapsed, since my arrival in this country, during the greatest part of which time, the different spheres, in which I have moved, have uni- formly placed me in a very conspicuous situation. Hence it is well known to many of my fellovv-cititzens, that if 1 had made a proper use of the opportunities presented to me, I might, agreeably to the common expression, have been now independent. But, like many others, on whom God has been graciously pleased to bestow considerable talents, I made a very improper use of them. I for many years, sacrificed freely at the shrine of Bacchus, and have duly received the reward, which, in general, falls to the lot of his votaries, viz. shame, disgrace and poverty, so that I, who might have rode in my coach, was, at the age of sixty, glad to seek an asylum for my declining years, in the Aims-House. About two months, however, previous to my going there, it pleased God, " from whom all holy desires, all good counsels, and all just works do proceed," to endow me with sufficient fortitude to overcome the greatest ene- my, that I or any unfortunate man ever encountered, I mean, Ardent Spirits. This victory, so very import- ant to me, was obtained on the 12th day of January last (a day, which as long as I live, I shall ever remember, with thanksgiving and prayer,) since which time, I have held, in perfect abhorrence, the bewitching draught. The following are some of the consequences arising from this salutary reform. The alteration in my countenance for the letter, has struck those, who were more intimately A 2 IV PREFACE. acquainted with me, with pleasure, as well as astoimfi- raent ; my constitution, which was greatly shattered, is # in a great measure, restored ; and what is of much great- er importance, I enjoy a uniform serenity and composure of mind, to which I had, for many years, been an absolute stranger. To this, I may add, as another blessing, thai many of my much respected friends, who lately with great propriety, treated me in a cool and distant manner, now receive me with a degree of cordiality and friendship, which abundantly shew, that they consider me as a new man. Amongst those, who are deservedly branded with the detestable epithet of drunkard, charity induces me to be- lieve, that there are few, who have not occasionally de> termined

They conveniently ignored the fact that there was huge popular demand and support for activist government.

At first, David couldn't exactly tell what had ripped him from the loving caress of sleep. He had previously been sleeping in his comfortable home wrapped in a warm blanket and resting his head on a nice fluffy pillow. Annoyed, he rested his head down once again and gently let his eyes fall. It was then as he jolted upright in bed that he realized what had awoken him. Although almost drowned out in the wind that whistled a soft melody through the night, he could hear what sounded like footsteps and nails dragging across the wooden exterior of his home. Curious, David allowed the soles of his feet to plop on the warm rug beneath him. Although sleep still cooed him, he eventually dragged himself along the perimeter of his room to the window. There he drew the blinds to get a better look. The pitter-patter of rain thumped against the thin glass in a soft beat that David soon found himself humming to. Combined with the inky dark blackness of the night, his visibility was heavily impaired and he was unable to see what was making the noise.

Credit: Copyright © PNAS, doi:10.1073/pnas.1402565111 (Phys.org) —In the hunt for early life, geobiologists seek evidence of ancient microbes in the form of trace fossils – geological records of biological activity – embedded in lavas beneath the ocean floor. Filamentous titanite (a calcium titanium silicate mineral) microtextures found in 3.45 billion-year-old volcanic pillow lavas of the Barberton greenstone belt of South Africa, have been argued previously2 to be Earth's oldest trace fossil, representing the mineralized remains of microbial tunnels in seafloor volcanic glass. However, scientists at the University of Bergen, Norway have reported new data based on in situ U-Pb (uranium-lead) dating, metamorphic temperature mapping constraints and morphological observations that bring the biological origin of these fossils into serious question. The new age determined for the titanite microtextures is much younger than the eruptive and seafloor hydrothermal age of the previously proposed bioalteration model. As a result, the researchers have analyzed these fossils' syngenicity (age as estimated by a textural, chemical, mineral, or biological feature formed at the same time as its encapsulating material) and biogenicity (any chemical and/or morphological signature preserved over a range of spatial scales in rocks, minerals, ice, or dust particles that are uniquely produced by past or present organisms). The scientists conclude that the oldest bona fide biogenic trace fossil now reverts to roughly 1.7 Ga microborings in silicified stromatolites found in China, and that the search for subsurface life – both on the early Earth as well as in extraterrestrial mafic–ultramafic rocks1, such as Martian basalts – be based not only on new biosignatures, but on new detection techniques as well.

Gratitude journals and their more public cousins—gratitude Facebook posts—have become mindful ways to connect with what is good in our lives. I've never done one, but it occurred to me a while back that doing a 365 Grateful for playwriting might illuminate a year's worth of reasons why we're so loyal to this sometimes discouraging pursuit. In 2014, there were many times I became aware of people, situations, events that only touched me because I wrote that first play and kept on writing–a phone call from a producer who wanted to share the tearful reactions my play evoked that evening, being part of the Buffalo theater community, meeting some super cool people during a production in a small town in the Catskills, the Dramatists Guild regional reps meeting, having actors in Ghana speak my words– as well as all the people, places, and things that just make it easier to keep on. Productions are wonderful, but being a playwright has generated so many rewards beyond just those, so, this year, now that Real Inspiration for Playwrights Project is finished, recording them all is my project for 2015. I'll tweet once each day under #365gratefulplaywright (follow me @donnahoke) and also post to my Donna Hoke, Playwright page on Facebook, then post the updated blog every two weeks so that nobody is overwhelmed. (I'll also start a new blog post every two weeks, so that this file doesn't become impossible!) If you're a playwright, think about what might go on your own list; it's humbling to see how lucky we really are. And so, continuing on with November/Part Two, AS A PLAYWRIGHT,
( i'm going to get blasted for saying this, i know i am) I really hope that everyone who is tossing around the word "censorship" realizes the irony in that their offense and reaction to said "censorship" is a culturally based one while they are also calling on others corrupting said culture. Things get changed because they either: A) Don't translate properly B Culturally, are seen differently C) Values of said culture are different Or usually, its a combination of all three. This is because we in the West, do not have a comparative concept to "idols", and what may be seen as sexual in one culture, isn't entirely in the other. Many people overlook these aspects when looking at changes when a game is coming west and like to treat every change as "censorship" when its far more complex then that what i'm trying to say is is that what might be considered OK in one country wont be in another. its a sad, but true fact. so instead of complaining on twitter or any other media comment section, go on your countries rating board and show them how this makes you feel...

Numerous concepts and practices can be observed in the United States Congress. These concepts and practices greatly influence how congressmen behave and how public policy is shaped. One such concept frequently used in congress is the use of the Special Order. Over the past few decades the special order has become more prevalent and influential in shaping behavior in congress. A special order, fundamentally, is a very simple concept. A special order is an opportunity after the House of Representatives has been adjourned for the day for a member to speak on any topic they wish. A member may speak from five minutes up to one hour after official legislation has ended for the day. Special orders are given a four hour long duration limit unless it is a Tuesday. On Tuesdays, special orders may last up until midnight. Since special orders are not part of official legislative work, most are given to an empty room. When giving a special order, a member must follow the rules of the House, the chamber's precedents, and the Speaker of the House. To make a special order, a member must gain admission from party leadership. Special orders are considered "unanimous consent practices". Because of this, any member is allowed access and it is very unlikely for anyone to object. Members also have the choice of either giving their special order speech on the House floor or simply having it recorded in the Congressional Record. The procedure of a special order tends to go as follows: Five minute speeches given by individual members, followed by speeches longer than five minutes given by party leaders or designee, and finally speeches longer than five minutes given by individual members. Members may also ask for permission towards the end of a special order period to make a speech. Although any member may make use of a special order, the minority party tends to make more use of them. Throughout a typical day of official legislative work, the majority party will utilize most of the time to speak and work on their own agenda. A special order gives the minority party the opportunity to bring attention to their agenda. Special orders also give members the opportunity to debate non-legislative issues. One major contribution to the influence of special orders is the introduction of new technology, most specifically the creation of C-SPAN. Once C-SPAN put cameras in the House of Representatives, a new opportunity was given to less powerful members. Less powerful members include new members and members of the minority party. When making a special order, a member has the opportunity to speak on television and reach a large audience. Members may use a special order to speak on current policy and bills, speak about national and international affairs, make eulogies and tributes, speak on issues salient to their constituents, and comment on party issues. Many members use this opportunity to speak to their constituents. Since a new member or a member of the minority party may not have to opportunity to speak during the day's official session, using a special order, they can now reach their constituents on television. Special orders give these less influential members of the house the ability to challenge the majority party and make a name for themselves. This new source of power has given new accountability and transparency to the house. Using special orders, the minority party can voice their opposition to majority party and hold them accountable. Special orders have gained some controversy in recent decades. They have shown their significance most clearly during the 1980s with congressman Newt Gingrich. At the time, Gingrich was a new and unknown member to the house. He was also a member of the minority, Republican Party. C-SPAN was also new at the time, and the legislative influence of special orders was still relatively unknown. After official legislative work was finished for the day, Gingrich would proceed to make a special order speech. Making these speeches, Gingrich was able to both call attention to the minority Republican agenda and also make criticism of the Democratic majority. Gingrich, who otherwise would not have had the opportunity to debate during the day's official work due to being a new member belonging to the minority party, had the opportunity to reach a large audience on national television. Controversy soon began to rise from Gingrich's new technique legislative debate. Regardless of whether he was within proper protocol when making the statements he made, it was clear that he had found a new and effective method of debate. Included in this report are three videos that provide examples of the effectiveness of special orders. Each one draws attention to a specific aspect of special orders that make them significant in the House of Representatives. The first video shows a video of Newt Gingrich speaking on the effectiveness of special orders. Gingrich explains how by using a special order speech, a member has access to national television. He explains how special orders give a member the opportunity to reach a large audience that they would otherwise never have the ability to reach. The second video shows an example of a special order given. The representative giving the speech in the video explains the significance of making special orders. He explains how special orders create the opportunity for both sides of the house to work together to shape legislation. Special orders allow a sense of collaboration between both parties that otherwise would

From April 5 to April 12, people around the country watched as Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy, backed by often armed supporters, stood in defiance of federal court orders to remove cattle he had illegally grazed on federal lands since the 1990s. Bundy supporters cast the drama a David versus Goliath clash between a Constitutionally-minded rancher and an out-of-control federal government. A closer look reveals a more complex story, offering insights in to the ability of the far right to engage in armed mobilizations on behalf of activists whose federal law violations get them into legal trouble. When the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) backed off from enforcing Bundy's long-standing grazing violations, far-rightists claimed victory for their ideas and paramilitary tactics, threatening to embolden those would use violence to advance far right political goals.

Nearly all of the 2011 funding for the conservative Franklin Center for Government and Public Integrity, which oversees state news sites nationwide, came from a single foundation that has distributed hundreds of millions of dollars to right-wing causes, according to a recent report of the Center for Public Integrity. CPI detailed that the foundation, Donors Trust, provided 95 percent of the Franklin Center funding in 2011, citing Internal Revenue Service documents. The Center uses that funding to support websites and affiliates providing free statehouse reporting from a "pro-taxpayer, pro-liberty, free market perspective" to local newspapers and other media across the country. The Center, which Media Matters highlighted in a lengthy July 2012 report, has launched more than 50 news sites covering state government in 39 states since it began in 2009 and claims to provide 10 percent of all state government news in the United States. Since it was created in 1999, Donors Trust and its affiliated organization, Donors Capital Fund, have raised more than $500 million from various individuals and organizations, among them billionaire industrialist Charles Koch, and doled out $400 million to a constellation of right-wing causes. That includes $86 million distributed in 2011 alone. Donors Trust gives many of its funding sources a way to hide their donations or "pass-through" money to various right-leaning organizations and media outlets, many of whom promote free-market ideas. The size and character of these donations has earned the group the moniker "the dark money ATM of the conservative movement." The $6.3 million donation to the Franklin Center in 2011 was the second-largest gift made that year by Donors Trust. Donors Trust and Donors Capital Fund had previously given a combined contribution of $25,000 to the Franklin Center in 2010. Major Donors Trust contributors include the Charles Koch-controlled Knowledge and Progress Fund. Marcus Owens, the former director of the IRS Exempt Organizations Division, told CPI, "Koch is among an exclusive pool of donors who have used Donors Trust as a 'pass-through.' It obscures the source of the money. It becomes a grant from Donors Trust, not a grant from the Koch brothers." CPI produced this graphic detailing the flow of money in recent years from Koch-backed and other right-wing foundations through Donors Trust to a variety of conservative groups. The Franklin Center is also staffed by veterans of groups affiliated with Charles Koch and his brother, David. Steven Greenhut, Franklin Center's vice president of journalism, was listed as a senior fellow at the Pacific Research Institute, a conservative think tank that has received significant funding from foundations headed by the Koch Brothers. Other top Franklin Center staffers with current or past Koch ties include Erik Telford, the Franklin Center's vice president of strategic initiatives & outreach; Mary Ellen Beatty, Franklin Center director of citizen outreach; Alicia Barnaby, Coalitions Coordinator; and the Franklin Center's director of development, Matt Hauck.

World Today In Louisiana, Sewage Pipe Mistakenly Diverted into Water Lines Aired May 25, 2000 - 8:09 p.m. ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. JIM MORET, CNN ANCHOR: In Louisiana, the public works director in Pineville resigned this week, several days after city workers discovered a stomach-churning mistake: a sewage pipe had been diverted into the water lines which supply about 60 homes. CNN's Charles Zewe reports. (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE) CHARLES ZEWE, CNN CORRESPONDENT (voice-over): At Zelma McCoy's house, tap water was the color of mud. ZELMA MCCOY: I had stomach cramps, and a couple days it put me in the bed to where I just didn't feel like doing anything. ZEWE: To Christy Chua (ph), the water reeked. CHRISTY CHUA: Whenever we'd take a shower, it really smelled. ZEWE: The women are among 350 residents of the Walden Point subdivision in Pineville, Louisiana who, unknowingly, drank raw sewage for more than two months. (on camera): Officials say it appears that city work crews, as they were making utility connections to this new building here, inadvertently and mistakenly attached a sewer line to a water main. (voice-over): Officials say pulverized threads of toilet paper came out of kitchen faucets and excrement built up in water heaters. How could this happen? MAYOR CLARENCE FIELDS, PINEVILLE, LOUISIANA: It was a mistake, it was a mistake, there's no doubt about that. ZEWE: Mayor Clarence Fields says the water and sewer lines are about the same size and are unmarked. Residents were temporarily ordered to boil drinking water. The city replaced a number of crusty water heaters and flushed the system. Two lawsuits have been filed so far. Health officials say, though, despite residents' complaints, water samples show no signs of bacteria and there have been no illnesses confirmed. DR. JOHN NAPONICK, LOUISIANA OFFICE OF PUBLIC HEALTH: The fact that it could happen, you know, may be disgusting, but so far there's been no medical evidence of anybody getting sick or having any problems because of this. ZEWE: In a bit of unfortunate irony for Mayor Fields, his re- election opponent is former Mayor Fred Baden, a plumber. FRED BADEN, FMR. MAYOR: It goes back to inexperience with people not paying attention to their job. ZEWE: Like many of her neighbors meanwhile, the sewer flap has prompted Zelma McCoy to start using bottled water for drinking and cooking. MCCOY: I'm just afraid right now, and I know it's going to be a long time before I trust that water again. ZEWE: Charles Zewe, CNN, Pineville, Louisiana.

A natural way for dogs to communicate is to bark at things they find or see, usually which are interesting or a threat to them. If you have a dog that barks too much, then you want to find a way to calm down the instinct by offering the best dog training. While you want to make sure your dog can express themselves sometimes by barking, you also want to focus on not letting the noise become a burden. Following are some of the dog training tips that help your dog to stop barking while establishing basic obedience rules for the home.Start young. If you have an older dog that hasn't been trained to stop barking, it is difficult to stop. You want to make sure that you train puppies not to bark if they are doing it too much. The younger you start training them, the easier it will be for them to understand the dog training commands.Understand what barking is for. Barks from a dog are used for several reasons. You want to make sure you understand why they bark and whether this can be prevented. Some common reasons for barking are from the dog being bored or lonely. If there are distractions that the dog feels are a threat, they may also bark. You can prevent dogs from barking by giving them extra attention or by getting another pet.Reward them when they stop. Just like other types of obedience training, you can easily stop your dog from barking by showing them when to be quiet. This is known as one of the best dog training methods. Dog training commands and words such as saying quiet, with a voice that has a low tone, will easily stop your dog from barking. Once they do stop, you can reward them by telling them good in a higher tone and by giving them a treat. However, you need to do this instantly after they stop so they understand what the reward is for.Anti bark collars. If your dog instinctively keeps barking at everything, then you can get a collar for extra training. When the dog barks, a stimulus or scent is set off which causes slight discomfort for the dog. If you aren't around and your dog starts barking, it will immediately stop them.Know when to train. You want to make sure you don't leave your dog in a position where they can't express themselves. Even if you have neighbors who don't like the dog barking, there are certain times where they should be able to speak. Knowing when to apply commands and training and when to let them bark helps them to feel comfortable while allowing you to apply limitations.The ability to offer the best dog training is one that is reliant on consistency and understanding your dog. If you have a pet that naturally wants to bark, then finding a way to monitor the behavior is the best step to take. Following these dog training tips can help you to establish better behavior with your dog while allowing them to express themselves at the right time.Before You Spend MORE Money On Expensive Dog Trainers or Products,Watch This Video First!Discover the powerful dog training secrets to eliminate over 30+ common behavioral dog and puppy issues with step-by-step instructions from one of the world's most skilled dog trainers!

Thinking back to the English summer of cricket, I first remembered a conversation with Steven Finn after the second Test against Sri Lanka. I asked him about James Vince, whose selection had delighted anyone with Hampshire cricket in their veins and anyone else who appreciated batting in its purest form. I was worried that Vince was confused by the demands of the higher game and was therefore afraid to parade his gifts. Finn told me to rest easy. Vince, he said, was the real deal; so much so that the bowlers didn't much like lining up against him. He had time to play, said Finn, making a quick bowler feel as if he were letting it go at gentle medium. I wondered about saying this to Vince, but I don't know him well and decided not to meddle.

MADHOUSE!Unlike their peer Production IG, who had an absolute turd of a show in 1996 called "Panzer Dragoon" (we daren't speak that name), Madhouse delivered a quality animation. Unfortunately, the licensing in NA was handled by Central Park Media, known for their schlockiness and giving dubs a bad name.Artwork and Animation: 8Madhouse, true to form, delivers a very high quality, fluid, and fast moving product that looks great for a mid 90s show. This came before the big CGI boom in the late 90s/early 00s, so we're saved from those horrors, and blessed with some very slick hand drawn animation. While there are some lazy moments with stillframe, the action was as good as it was going to get for a show of this budget, and it is very easy to watch.Sound and Voice Acting: 3This is where the problems begin, and it's mostly on the voice acting front.My biggest problem with this is on a technical level, and it's partially a result of the technology at the time, and partly because they used junk equipment. When there's no music (which is usually mixed at a higher level than the voices anyway, making it hard to hear), there's a slight static that everything made before the digital age has. It's there, just trust me.Well, when the actors are speaking, you can hear hard mic cuts, where the only sound mixed is that of their voice, then it cuts back to "silence" which resumes the static scratching sound, which is a bit jarring. They also apparently didn't know what pop filters were, and you can hear their lips smacking together as they talk.Half the VA sound really bored, or phoned in, it's just this side of bad cheesy, but not bad enough to laugh at, since it takes itself seriously. A lot of the music sounds like it came straight out of Super Mario Kart, but the ending themes are pretty groovy.Story: 6Being that Birdy the Mighty is incomplete, it's natural to say that it's got a poor story, but I disagree. It's "fair". The first episode is just an intro to Birdy and Tsutomu, but 2-4 cover the plot. It's nothing original- an investigation into a growing series of crimes perpetrated by an intergalactic criminal intent on creating psionic soldiers with which to destroy the intergalactic police organization hunting him. The mastermind has created a serum through a series of genetic tests on himself and others which turns the recipient of it into a hulking reptilian psionic rage monster (think Akira- it definitely had some influences here). There is another villain who is explored , but not resolved, which hurt the show, but in a way left it open ended for an eventual revisitation.Characters: 7 ---*minor 1st episode spoilers*---Tsutomu is a weenie and a giant loser who lucklessly happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and ends up dead while the Intergalactic supercop Birdy is chasing a criminal. As punishment for ending the poor kid's pathetic life, Birdy is instructed by her giant Radroach of a boss to ressurect Tsutomu by morphing bodies with him. They're able to switch at will, and both have their own lives to attend to, which often leads to some pretty funny results.Birdy herself is a confident and capable fighter, but impulsive and hot-headed, a trait she vehemently denies, then tries to fight someone over for saying, hah. She's tough, and she don't take no crap- which sometimes ends in billions of dollars in destruction of property, but she makes sure to kick enough intergalactic ass to cover the bill.Enjoyment: 9I picked this up on a whim, like most of my obscure titles, and while the first episode was pretty boring, the 2nd-4th were really good. There's some brutal action including arm and leg breaks, and several awesome sequences- one where an entire skyscraper is taken down in a battle, and a second where there's a telekinetic fight that ends with an oil tanker being thrown into a character who crashes through a 6 foot thick concrete wall! There's a few cheeseball lines of dialogue to snicker at too.Overall: 7It has some over the top moments, but overall it's a good twist on the typical superpower shonen. A handy female protagonist who shows the beta male how it's done, and a fun concept of the body switching made for a good little show.Recommend?Sure. It's a nice change of pace, and at 120 minutes runtime, not a big investment.

(Click here for the first of many…) So we have our first song for Lisbon, and it isn't half bad, actually. Eugent Bushpepa's buildy pop rock ballad may have no discernible chorus, but it's got atmosphere by the bucketload, and an irresistible whoa-whoa chorus that will encourage metaphorical lighters in the air before the second minute is out. After my crushing disappointment at learning that my two aggregations of old blokes didn't even make the final, and then my concern that some of the frocky horror lady ballads were going to nip it after some enormous crowd reactions, I began to feel more confident after the boy here got a bigger cheer on than most other songs got on their way off the stage. But then I got the fear again as I saw the jury - a busload of middle-aged men in sobre suits and sombre expressions, two out of place ladies and one of the Allman Brothers. But somehow his soaring high notes and optimistic chord progressions won over the old boys and bagged him the ticket to Portugal. And while it's no overall winner, it's got jury bait written all over it, and could well see them comfortably into the final. It's certainly quite unlike anything Albania have ever sent before, and shouldn't need too much of an upgrade over the festive season, so we're looking forward to seeing how well it performs.

On a warm day in April 2013, I was sitting in a friend's kitchen in Paris, trying to engineer serendipity. I was trying to get my computer to write music on its own. I wanted to be able to turn it on and have it spit out not just any goofy little algorithmic tune but beautiful, compelling, mysterious music; something I'd be proud to have written myself. The kitchen window was open, and as I listened to the sounds of children playing in the courtyard below, I thought about how the melodies of their voices made serendipitous counterpoint with the songs of nearby birds and the intermittent drone of traffic on the rue d'Alésia.

In 1965, a year before hooking up with the musicians who would form The Buffalo Springfield, Neil Young had a brief stint in a Canadian rock group called The Mynah Birds fronted by Rick James (yes, THAT Rick James). At this point in James' career he was known as Ricky James Matthew and did a stellar imitation of Mick Jagger. The group had a raw exciting sound that hinted at The Stones, Them, and various American garage bands. The Mynah Birds nailed a deal with Motown Records (the first white band to do so) and recorded sixteen tracks in Detroit. But things turned bad.

To identify protective dietary predictors amongst long-lived elderly people (N= 785), the "Food Habits in Later Life "(FHILL) study was undertaken among five cohorts in Japan, Sweden, Greece and Australia. Between 1988 and 1991, baseline data on food intakes were collected. There were 785 participants aged 70 and over that were followed up to seven years. Based on an alternative Cox Proportional Hazard model adjusted to age at enrollment (in 5-year intervals), gender and smoking, the legume food group showed 7-8% reduction in mortality hazard ratio for every 20g increase in daily intake with or without controlling for ethnicity (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.85-0.99 and RR 0.93; 95% CI 0.87-0.99, respectively). Other food groups were not found to be consistently significant in predicting survival amongst the FHILL cohorts.

As part of an ongoing survey of the behavioral responses of vertebrates to abrupt changes in gravity, we report here on the reactions of bats (Carollia perspicillata) exposed to altered gravity during parabolic aircraft flight. In microgravity, mammals typically behave as if they were upside-down and exhibit repetitive righting reflexes, which often lead to long axis rolling. Since bats, however, normally rest upside-down, we hypothesized that they would not roll in microgravity. Only one of three specimens attempted to fly during microgravity. None rolled or performed any righting maneuvers. During periods of microgravity the bats partially extended their forearms but kept their wings folded and parallel to the body. Between parabolas and occasionally during microgravity the bats groomed themselves. Both the extended limbs and autogrooming may be stress responses to the novel stimulus of altered gravity. This is the first behavioral record of Chiroptera in microgravity.

BHOPAL: Two people kidnapped a boy from Indore, bundled him in a vehicle to Bhopal, confined him in a flat here and sodomised and filmed him in the nude for four days. The minor was a model and aspiring actor.The minor was rescued after he made a desperate call on 100 and told police he was locked in a house in Bhopal. Police traced the SOS call to Bima Kunj in Kolar area of the state capital and freed him from his captors.The accused have been slapped under stringent sections of POCSO Act, and also booked for kidnapping, wrongful confinement and sodomy. A laptop and mobile of accused have been seized.One of the accused, an MBA, has been nabbed while the other is on the run. Additional superintendent of police (crime) Shailendra Singh Chouhan, who spearheaded the rescue operation, said "The call was received on Saturday afternoon. We traced the caller's location and number and called back the boy. He told me he is in flat, which is surrounded with multiple buildings, but had no idea of the location. Eight teams were formed to track him."After searching 17 buildings, police zeroed in on the flat in which the boy was confined. The house was identified on the basis of colour of its main door as told by the boy.As pre-planned, police knocked five times to signal the boy about their presence. The minor responded as advised by police. The flat was locked from outside. Police kept vigil and waited in ambush for the accused. A man finally arrived at night.Police nabbed him and seized keys of the flat. The house was later opened and the boy was rescued. Accused, Dinesh Gupta, 31, an MBA, who works in a company, resides in the same flat on rent.The boy said he had never met him before the abduction. The accused would return at night, sodomise him and leave in the morning after locking him from outside. The boy said the goons would threaten him that they would make public his obscene videos if he made raised a hue and cry, police said.Accused, Dinesh Gupta is a native of Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh. Police said they are verifying his criminal record. The flat he took on rent in Kolar belongs to a woman LIC agent.The boy's parents were contacted. They came to Bhopal and minor was handed over to them.No balance in phone, but call to 100 was lifeline:The 17-year-old boy is a class 12 student and resident of Dhar. He had come to Indore for an audition for Balaji Films on September 30. He was heading towards bus stand when he was kidnapped near Sayaji Hotel, Indore.He told police he was walking when his captors sprayed a chemical on his face and he suffered a blackout. He has no idea what happened after that. He had his mobile phone with him, but there was no balance in it. When he regained consciousness, he found himself in Bhopal's hellhole flat. As the ordeal continued, he suddenly realised that he could call 100 even he had no balance in his phone. That's how police were tipped off that led to his rescue.

Zakaria Amara is one of Canada's notorious criminals. He's a convicted terrorist, one of the so-called "Toronto 18," an Al Qaeda-inspired group that opposed our military role in Afghanistan. A decade ago members conspired to attack Parliament, blow up truck bombs at the Toronto Stock Exchange and other downtown sites during rush hour, and bomb a military base. Justice Bruce Durno called the plots "spine-chilling" when he sentenced Amara, a mastermind, to life in prison in 2010. Had the group succeeded in detonating one-tonne bombs, the result "would have been catastrophic," the judge said, "the most horrific crime Canada has ever seen," with potentially enormous loss of life.

His boss played the popular strategy game, Sid Meier's Civilization V, which, unlike previous versions, is hex-based rather than square. Why?"A lesson in geek geometry: Square tiles have typically been viewed as inferior because the distance from the center of one tile to the next is not constant (moving diagonally moves you further than moving side to side), while a move in any direction from a hexagonal tiles is equidistant." -Nick MokeyEven if you don't play Civilization V (or Settlers of Catan), this handmade perfect bound notebook has a peculiar way of getting your creative juices flowing.<3===If you're ordering 10 or more Hex Paper notebooks, enjoy our bulk rates:===KEEP SHOPPING >> https://www.etsy.com/shop/SlimNote
Sunny days on Sesame Street?
Last month, a franchise synonymous with winning scored another victory. The New York Yankees won a court ruling against a company that had attempted to register the phrase "Baseballs Evil Empire." The Yankees may not have appreciated it when Red Sox president Larry Lucchino first used the term to describe them in 2002, but if anyone was going to make money off the phrase, damn it, it was going to be them. Even if it means, as written in the judges' decision, "The record shows that there is only one Evil Empire in baseball and it is the New York Yankees."
Olive oil may get all the press, but safflower oil is emerging as a health superstar in its own right. Made from the seeds of safflowers, which are similar to sunflowers, this oil contains healthy fats and may even help prevent cardiovascular disease. All oils are pure fat, however, which means they're high in calories. Use safflower oil sparingly to help avoid unwanted weight gain.
Forty years ago, Patterson in his pioneering work on lead isotopes defined the age of the Earth and of the meteorites with 4.55 Ga. We reconsider the question of the age of the Earth and its relation to the age of the meteorites, and similar to Patterson's approach, we use lead isotope systematics.
On Twitter this morning, an ex-Baltimore police sergeant named Michael A. Wood detailed a litany of abuses he witnessed or participated in while on the job.

Amy Schumer is keeping a sense of humor about all the critics who feel the need to comment about her size on social media.
The bank apologised to Mr Jetley in a statement A man who chose "Lloyds is pants" as his telephone banking password said he found it had been changed by a member of staff to "no it's not". Steve Jetley, from Shrewsbury, said he chose the password after falling out with Lloyds TSB over insurance that came free with an account. He said he was then banned from changing it back or to another password of "Barclays is better". The bank apologised and said the staff member no longer worked there. Mr Jetley said he first realised his security password had been changed when a call centre staff member told him his code word did not match with the one on the computer. "I thought it was actually quite a funny response," he said. I tried 'Barclays is better' and that didn't go down too well either

It is part of the standard compensation package for managers of private equity funds.
On May 20th, an EF5 tornado, one of the most powerful tornadoes ever measured by modern equipment, hit the town of Moore, Oklahoma. Jack Haden was one of the survivors of the utter devestation that wrecked his hometown, though his 2003 Mustang V6 was not so lucky. Yet Haden took a terrible thing and turned it into a symbol of the town's strength, stripping the roof and doors from his wrecked pony car and driving it around town like a go-kart.

Toshiba's first DynaPad, released in 1993, came at a time when touchscreen tablets were new to the tech world. The Japanese company's new DynaPad — a Windows 10 two-in-one officially announced today after a prototype appeared at IFA 2015 last month — joins a market flooded with tablet-sized touchscreen devices. But even though, like many of its peers, it looks a lot like Microsoft's own Surface, with a thin design, keyboard dock, and 12-inch display, Toshiba says its new DynaPad has some of its own unique features.

A guide by Aroc SyllinBehAll the rat factions you see in missions have a primary damage, a secondary damage and sometimes other marginal damage types.Everyone knows the rat damage types (example: guristas do kinetic and thermal), its in half the character bios. What isn't clearly stated is damage type proportions, and that is the key to good mission tanking.So here is a breakdown of those proportions:Gurista/EoM: 0.75 kin/0.25 thermAngel: 0.7 exp/0.2 kin/0.1 emSansha/Blood raider/Amarr empire: 0.5 em/0.5 thermSerpentis/Caldari state: 0.5 kin/0.5 thermGallente federation: 0.5 kin/0.4 therm/0.1 emMinmatar republic: 0.5 exp/0.2 em/0.2 kin/0.1 thermMercenaries: 0.5 therm/0.3 kin/0.1 exp/0.1 emRogue drones: 0.7 exp/0.2 kin/0.1 thermI calculated those from the eve.info mission dps lists, of course they may be flawed, feel free to make your own calcs. And if you choose to trust me, please don't come complaining if you're blown up.This article applies mostly to LVL4 missions as they're the ones needing the most tank.For a LVL4 battleship setup, I recommend dedicating 1-2 slots to hp regen and 4 slots to resists, the rest is up to you.Hp regen is done by a Large armor repairer on armor tanks and a Large (or X-Large) shield booster+Shield boost amplifier on shield tanks.So here is the same breakdown as above but translated in hardeners:This applies to ships with no resists bonus, for these it's specific for each ship (use EFT).Gurista/EoM: 3*Kin active/1*Therm activeAngel: armor tanks: 3*Exp active/1*Kin active - shield tanks: 2*Exp active/2*inv fieldSansha/Blood raider/Amarr empire: 2*Em active/2*Therm activeSerpentis/Caldari state/Gallente federation: 2*Kin active/2*Therm activeMinmatar republic: armor tanks: 2*Exp active/1*Kin active/1*DCU - shield tanks: 1*Em active/1*Exp active/2*Inv fieldMercenaries: armor tanks: 2*Kin active/2*Therm active - shield tanks: 2*Therm active/1*Kin active/1*Inv fieldRogue drones: armor tanks: 3*Exp active/1*Kin active - shield tanks: 1*Exp active/1*Kin active/2*Inv fieldYour mileage may vary due to slight differences in racial base resists, don't hesitate to check it.As you armor tankers may have noticed, I prefer damage controls over EANMs, while the later gives better resists it's nice to have a 50-60% hardened hull for that emergency warp out. And, best of all, damage controls are not stacked it seems.If you can afford it slotwise, you might want to swap a damage mod for a damage control (raising your resist slots to 5) when facing those npc's that are hitting your weakest natural resists (angel, drones, ... for armor tanks, sansha, blood, ... for shield tanks)The skills used are the same for compared setups.Here is the example of an armor tanked Typhoon:Omni fit:Large armor repairer II2*N-type Expl active hardenerN-type Therm active hardenerN-type Kin active hardenerem70/th68/ki60/ex74tanks 243dps vs GuristasSpecialised fit:Large armor repairer II3*N-type Kin active hardenerN-type Therm active hardenerem70/th68/ki85/ex10tanks 508dps vs GuristasHere is the example of a shield tanked Maelstrom:Large shield booster IIShield boost amplifier IIPhoton scattering field IIHeat dissipation field II2*Inv field IIem72/th78/ki69/ex79tanks 420dps vs GuristasSpecialised fit:Large shield booster IIShield boost amplifier II3*Ballistic deflection field IIHeat dissipation field IIem0/th64/ki90/ex60tanks 936dps vs GuristasNote: The Mael uses a large booster because it has a bonus to shield boost amount, for a raven the same setup tanks about 700dps.

How do members of the 114th Congress, which starts next week, compare with the average American? The most obvious difference is that they are 66 times as likely to be lawyers. (For Senate Democrats, the figure is 112 times.) This may explain why America has so many laws, and why some are longer than "War and Peace". Congressfolk are three times as likely as other Americans to have served in the armed forces and 1.6 times as likely to be male. They are slightly whiter than the nation they serve, and far older: 25% are over 65, compared with 14% of Americans. Protestants and Catholics are well represented on Capitol Hill; Mormons and Jews punch above their weight. Hardly any lawmakers, however, admit to being atheists or agnostics.

It was so refreshing to read this novel. I had a few let downs in the book department of late, and this one really knocked it out of the park.

Placebo interventions are often claimed to substantially improve patient‐reported and observer‐reported outcomes in many clinical conditions, but most reports on effects of placebos are based on studies that have not randomised patients to placebo or no treatment. Two previous versions of this review from 2001 and 2004 found that placebo interventions in general did not have clinically important effects, but that there were possible beneficial effects on patient‐reported outcomes, especially pain. Since then several relevant trials have been published.

We have shown that dietary GHG emissions associated with self-selected diets in the UK are strongly associated with the amount of animal-based products in the diet. After adjustment for sex and age, an average 2,000 kcal high meat diet had 2.5 times as many GHG emissions than an average 2,000 kcal vegan diet. This is the first study to demonstrate these differences in real self-selected diets of meat eaters and those who abstain from meat. There were also significant trends towards lower saturated fat, higher fibre and higher fruit and vegetable intake (but a higher intake of sugars) as the quantity of animal-based products in the diet decreases. Previous analyses of the same cohort have demonstrated lower BMI (Davey et al. 2003) and fewer ischaemic heart disease events (Crowe et al. 2013) in diet groups with lower intakes of animal products. Improved cardiovascular outcomes for vegetarian diets have been demonstrated in meta-analyses of cohort studies conducted in western populations (Huang et al. 2012; Key et al. 1999). Although observational studies are susceptible to residual confounding, non-systematic reviews of RCTs have demonstrated beneficial effects of plant-based diets on lipids (Ferdowsian and Barnard 2009) and weight status (Berkow and Barnard 2006). This suggests that advice to reduce the amount of meat and animal-based products in the diet would be consistent with the definition of a 'healthy, sustainable diet', although reductions of meat at the population level may pose nutritional challenges for key nutrients including iron and zinc which should be monitored (Millward and Garnett 2010).

The land war in Europe became a destructive machine, consuming supplies, equipment, and soldiers at massive rates. Resupply ships from the home front and allies streamed across the Atlantic, braving submarine attacks, underwater mines, and aerial bombardment. Battleships clashed with each other from the Indian Ocean to the North Sea, competing for control of colonial territory and home ports. New technologies were invented and refined, such as submarine warfare, camouflaged hulls, and massive water-borne aircraft carriers. And countless thousands of sailors, soldiers, passengers, and crew members were sent to the bottom of the sea. I've gathered photographs of the Great War from dozens of collections, some digitized for the first time, to try to tell the story of the conflict, those caught up in it, and how much it affected the world. This entry is part 7 of a 10-part series on World War I.

I've only been playing League for month so give me a break if there are some non League cosplayers that have snuck in here.
The thinking child is not antisocial (he is, in fact, the only type of child fit for social relationships). When he develops his first values and conscious convictions, particularly as he approaches adolescence, he feels an intense desire to share them with a friend who would understand him; if frustrated, he feels an acute sense of loneliness. (Loneliness is specifically the experience of this type of child—or adult; it is the experience of those who have something to offer. The emotion that drives conformists to "belong," is not loneliness, but fear—the fear of intellectual independence and responsibility. The thinking child seeks equals; the conformist seeks protectors.)

Geological evidence suggests that Earth may have had surface water -- and thus conditions to support life -- billions of years earlier than previously thought. Scientists reconstructed the portrait of early Earth by reading the telltale chemical composition of the oldest known terrestrial rock. The 4.4-billion-year-old mineral sample suggests that early Earth was not a roiling ocean of magma, but instead was cool enough for water, continents, and conditions that could have supported life. The age of the sample may also undermine accepted current views on how and when the moon was formed. The research was supported in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF), and is published in this week's issue of the journal Nature.

The Ultimate Fighter Latim America 3 Finale is just around the corner and . . . wow. Let's just call it UFC: Mouthful. As Rafael Dos Anjos and Tony Ferguson prepare to fight for a shot at the lightweight title--the same belt that Dos Anjos seemed certain to keep just a few months ago--the entire event seems overshadowed by the tentpole extravaganza around the corner: UFC 205. With a stacked undercard, three title fights, and the charismatic anchor of Conor McGregor at its head, it's no wonder that this weekend's card is flying a little bit under the radar.
By nearly every measure 2016 was an absolute garbage year, a stretch of time that would have best been taken out back and shot. There's little to look back on fondly, but look back we did… at the whole wretched thing. Using Google Trends we mapped out what each state Googled more frequently than other state in 2016. We measured Google searches for world events, famous people who passed away and those who made news, things that made us laugh and cry and shake our fists, new movies and shows, and even the stupid memes and celebrity missteps that distracted us from the depressing misery that was 2016. We took this snapshot of 2016 and put it on the map above, and made a more complete list below.
From the July 2007 Issue of Cycle World My middle-aged brother-in-law was bitten by the sportbike bug a few years back. As the granddad of a dozen and counting, he stood little chance of my big sis allowing a sleek, seductive supersport mistress to enter the family fold. My recommendation at the time resulted in the purchase of Yamaha's then newly introduced FZ1. It's easy to imagine that the Tuning Fork Folks were thinking of guys just like my sister's husband–law-abiding family men inflicted with midlife moto-crisis–when they came up with the clever idea to cloak their YZF-R1 motor in a more-civilized guise. But if another friend or relative were to call today expressing interest in finding a rational sportbike offering performance and versatility, would I send them Suzuki's way for a fling with the all-new Bandit 1250S? While the original Big Bandito didn't fit what my brother-in-law was looking for at the time, following a year's hiatus, the Bandit 1250S has re-entered Suzuki's stateside lineup bringing a promise of improved power and handling over the venerable 1200 it has replaced. Can it give the FZ1 a run for its money in terms of performance and riding excitement, is it the more refined and versatile of the two, or is it simply a nice bike and a good value? Needing an answer to these questions should the phone ring, we rounded up the two players and put them through the full gamut of weight, measure, dyno, dragstrip and top-speed testing, along with comparative street riding impressions. Built specifically for the Bandit, Suzuki's all-new 1255cc, liquid-cooled, fuel-injected, dohc inline-Four has replaced the mid-Eighties air/oil-cooled design that powered its predecessor. The engine layout closely resembles the previous configuration with its centrally located cam chain and the sidedraft throttle bodies feeding a fairly upright cylinder bank. The engine is more compact, however, featuring vertically stacked transmission shafts, and now the 'box has a sixth gear ratio for a more relaxed cruise rpm on the freeway. A secondary balancer shaft driven off the crank has also been incorporated for reduced vibration at all speeds.
Community mental health centers, also referred to as Local Mental Health Authorities (LMHAs) provide services to a specific geographic area of the state, called the local service area.

DSHS contracts with 39 Community Mental Health Centers and NorthSTAR to deliver mental health services in communities across Texas.

In a shopping centre parking lot, does the stop sign have any force in law? Can a policeman fine someone for speeding in that same parking lot? My take on the issue is that the sign has no force in law because it is on private property, and the Highway Traffic Act cannot be enforced, since it is not a public thoroughfare. Police officers acting as agents of the property owner may be able to lay charges under the "Public Mischief" label for stunt driving, for example, but not under the HTA. What happens in the event of a fender bender on private property? Do the police attend the call, adjudicate who is to blame, and lay charges accordingly? This is a very important issue, because it touches on insurance (who is to blame in an accident), demerit points, etc. – Patrick, Edmonton

Dogs aren't the only pets who sometimes bite the hands that feed them. Cats do too, and when they strike a hand, can inject bacteria deep into joints and tissue, perfect breeding grounds for infection. Cat bites to the hand are so dangerous, 1 in 3 patients with such wounds had to be hospitalized, a Mayo Clinic study covering three years showed. Two-third of those hospitalized needed surgery. Middle-aged women were the most common bite victims, according to the research, published in the Journal of Hand Surgery.
UFOs - not the flying saucer type. I'm talking about Unfinished Objects. The projects that we start, and for whatever reason, decide we don't want to finish. Except we don't really decide that we don't want to finish them - we let them languish for years, at the bottom of our queues. We turn them into "someday" projects ("Someday I'll finish this"). We hem, and we haw, and we don't really want to work on them, but we can't justify not finishing them.
Equating an intimate act to a business transaction is not only crass and reductive; it is also analytically misleading. The analogy to commerce implies an adversarial situation wherein the buyer always wants to pay the minimum and the seller wants to get the maximum. But men often find themselves bestowing attention, falling in love, and getting married after they have already been sleeping with the woman in question. Sexual economics has trouble accounting for that. Men willingly overspend, which describes approximately no one who buys a car. Similarly, the pay-for-play hypothesis fails to capture the fact that most women do not want to extract caring and love from a person disinclined to offer it, and they do not see sex as something they wish they could avoid until marriage.

If you have diabetes, you already know the important role that diet plays in helping you control your blood sugar. Although you may need to eat more calories and protein when you're pregnant, as a diabetic you still need to pay close attention to your diet to keep blood sugar under control. Uncontrolled blood sugars not only affect your health but the baby's as well. Your doctor can help you determine your specific calorie needs, but a 2,200-calorie diet is a good place to start.

Recent reports suggest that atypical endometrial hyperplasia diagnosed by biopsy or curettage is accompanied by a higher than expected risk of coexistent invasive cancer. In order to test this hypothesis we reviewed the pathology and clinical history of all patients at our institution who underwent hysterectomy for endometrial hyperplasia with or without cytologic atypia. We found 24 patients of 45 with a preoperative diagnosis of hyperplasia with cytologic atypia, and 21 with simple or complex hyperplasia without atypia. No cancers were found at surgery in the latter group nor were any significant historical differences found between the two groups. Of the patients with atypia, 12/24 (50%) had an endometrial carcinoma and nine patients (37.5%) were stage IB or greater. This is a significantly greater risk than previously reported in the literature. Endometrial hyperplasia with cytologic atypia may carry a higher risk of coexistent invasive endometrial carcinoma than previously believed. Methods to identify those patients at highest risk should be determined.

History: The Churchills were an independent barnstorming club from Bismarck, North Dakota. Long before Jackie Robinson broke the Major League color barrier in 1947, the Churchills featured an integrated roster with black stars such as Ted "Double-Duty" Radcliffe, Hall of Famer Hilton Smith, and the legendary Satchel Paige. With Paige anchoring the pitching rotation in 1935, the Churchills won that year's National Baseball Conference semi-pro baseball tournament in Wichita, Kansas. Product Details:

Fellow Citizens: There has been a lot of media attention to the recent incident where George Zimmerman shot and killed Trayvon Martin. This is indeed a tragic situation and has caused a flood of questions and strong emotions from within our community, the region and nation. On behalf of the employees of the City of Sanford, Our deepest sympathy and prayers go out to the family and friends of Trayvon Martin. As a father, I can only image the pain Trayvon's family must be going though. In an effort to continue to be as responsive as possible to the public seeking information on the incident, I have asked Chief Lee to provide answers to some of the most frequently asked questions regarding this matter. Below are his responses. Please understand that since this is still an ongoing investigation, the Police Department is limited in what information it can publicly release. The City of Sanford is committed to insuring that justice is served and, therefore, the City of Sanford has contacted the United States Attorney General's Office for assistance in this matter. The men and women of the Sanford Police Department extend our heartfelt sympathies to the Martin family. This is indeed a tragic situation. The death of anyone due to violence, especially a 17 year old young man, is morally appalling. As this incident has generated a lot of media attention, we wanted to provide answers to some of the most frequently asked questions.

( Self portrait by Liza Cowan, copyright hers 2007) This night one year ago, I wrote my first e-mail to Liza Cowan. I knew of her for at 30+ years, and her influence on my life had been intense. As one of the founding voices of Lesbian-feminism, her courage and clarity had helped bring me to similar attributes. And, I'd written her decades earlier, when she and Penny House were co-editing DYKE: A Quarterly . I was living in a Lesbian land collective that subscribed to DYKE , and we'd noticed their publishing name was Tomato Publications. We'd had discussions about why that name -- it certainly wasn't from the sexist term for women, because Liza was one of the language pioneers helped us unravel gender role conditioning. Eventually, I sat down and wrote her (circa 1978), posing the question: "Why Tomato Publications?" She wrote me a postcard back that began "Why not?" A familiar humor, now. Then she explained they'd read a national study which said that men's favorite vegetable was cucumbers, while women's was tomatoes. Somehow our physical paths never crossed in all that time, although they could have more than once. She remained an influence across a distance. I often wondered what she was doing now. In June of 2006, I began writing what Liza has called the Great American Lesbian Novel. Since the main character was based on me, I gave her the same connection to Liza that I had, and you can't write a novel about politically-active and culturally-revolutionary 70's dykes without mentioning Liza Cowan more than once. Some time during that summer, I found out that Alison Bechdel was having an art show at a gallery in her town of Burlington, and when I investigated it, I discovered the gallery was owned by none other than Liza. Now I knew what she was doing. I found the Pine Street Art Works website and munched my way through it, then went on to Liza's personal website and discovered her art. Which blew me out of the water. In August, partly as an antidote to extreme isolation and personal difficulty, I did something I never had before: I posted a comment to a blog. It was in response to attacks on Lesbian cultural institutions and to some really shitty thinking about children, both of which I found impossible to ignore. I was attacked, then defended, then found a small but growing online voice. In the course of that thread, Liza posted -- not about the main topic, about something else, but it was clearly her. Kinda cool. I've been a leader since I was a teenager, and an artist (writer) for longer than that. I really despise the American cult of celebrity, how people fawn on those who have fame and a certain kind of ability. I find it self-disempowering and just plain icky, especially if I'm on the receiving end. If you want a relationship with me, ask for it, and accept my no if that's what you hear. If you want to fantasize about me, I don't give my consent. And if you don't have a personal relationship with me, trust me, you don't know me through my poetry, my other writing, or my activism. You know only those aspects of me. I have demons and damage. I also pretty much like myself just fine, but the reasons I like myself are not necessarily what you'll see from my public persona. So I don't indulge in being star-struck, and I don't let others aim it at me. It's really easy to discourage, if you're honest and not passive-aggressive out it. And, of course, if you don't secretly crave it. So I was reluctant to write Liza what I wanted to write her, which was basically, how the hell are you? How's it been for you the last couple of decades, as we've seen our movement revised, reviled, lied about in every possible way, and still they can't shut us up or kill us off? Mostly, I wanted to know if she was happy, what she was thinking about, and how she was expressing herself. It mattered to me. I also wanted to tell her how much her work had meant to me and my life, because I think every artist and leader deserves to hear that in a non-adulatory way. But I had to make sure I wasn't coming from a place where there were any strings attached. Just a "thanks" was appropriate, I felt. (Photograph by Liza Cowan, copyright hers) So, it took me until October 13th. I had gone back to her website often, to look at the art again -- great art is something I never quite get enough of. And finally I wrote down what the art sparked in me, read it over, decided it was "clean", and posted it to her website. Only it wouldn't go through.

Most of the evidence that taking supplements of vitamin C can delay progression or improve survival in people with HIV is based mainly on the test tube studies demonstrating its anti-HIV effects. These studies also suggest that vitamin C's in vitro activity against HIV is enhanced when it is used in combination with N-acetyl cysteine (NAC).

Abstract Iron deficiency anaemia is one of the most common disorders in the world. Also, one third of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients suffer from recurrent anaemia. Anaemia has significant impact on the quality of life of affected patients. Chronic fatigue, a frequent IBD symptom itself, is commonly caused by anaemia and may debilitate patients as much as abdominal pain or diarrhoea. Common therapeutic targets are the mechanisms behind anaemia of chronic disease and iron deficiency. It is our experience that virtually all patients with IBD associated anaemia can be successfully treated with a combination of iron sucrose and erythropoietin, which then may positively affect the misled immune response in IBD.

Real-time strategy games are, in a way, games of competitive economics. Within the framework of a real-time strategy match, in almost every case players are asked to build an economy – building and growing an income comprised of 1 or more resources (often, 2 – 4 resources of varying application and scarcity) and commit those resources in various ways: expending the potential of those resources into production structures, upgrades of various types, and units. Units, of course, are the typical means of player interaction with the other player or players in a match. They deal damage to the other units and structures in the game, which becomes a contest of who can produce the most units and utilize them in the most efficient manner.
Cards Against Humanity's Nuisance Committee super PAC launched Wednesday by buying its first anti-Donald Trump billboard just outside Chicago O'Hare International Airport.The committee was named for a part of Cards Against Humanity co-founder Max Temkin's family history. According to the Nuisance Committee, Temkin's grandfather Ira Weinstein was shot down over Germany during a combat mission in World War II and interned in a POW camp. At the camp, Weinstein and other Jewish POWs banded together to form a "nuisance committee" to irritate their Nazi captors in ways that wouldn't get them killed.In a press release the group said, "The comparison between Trump and Hitler is intentional."The billboard reads, "If Trump is so rich how come he didn't buy this billboard?" and directs people to trumpdoesntpaytaxes.com The super PAC's funds come from the ongoing sales of Donald Trump- and Hillary Clinton-themed expansion packs for the popular card game."At the end of this promotion, Cards Against Humanity will tally up the sales of both packs, and depending on which pack gets more support, we will donate all the money in support of Hillary Clinton's campaign," they said on their sales site.In their FAQ, Cards Against Humanity clarifies that funds will be split between contributions to Hillary Clinton's PAC, contributions to groups opposing Trump and get out the vote programs in swing states.Trump made a fundraising and campaign stop in Chiacgo and the suburbs Wednesday. Clinton is expected in Chicago Thursday.

I've been studying the amygdala for more than 30 years. When I started this work, research on this brain region was a lonely field of inquiry. The hippocampus was all the , and I sometimes felt of the attention lavished on this brain region because of its contribution to memory. These days, though, it is the amygdala that is in the spotlight. This little neural nugget has gone from an obscure area of the brain to practically a household word, one that has come to be synonymous with " ." And for many people, my name, too, is practically synonymous with "fear." I am often said to have identified the amygdala as the brain's "fear" center. But the fact is, I have not done this, nor has anyone else.

Yet this is, probably, the greatest player in the game, mobbed by screaming fans wherever he goes and in such commercial demand that his black cotton jacket is a veritable advertising billboard. On one breast is the logo of a law firm, on another an investment bank, on one arm an electrical company, and on the other a prominent Oslo newspaper — just some of the deals that earn him about £1m a year.

When it comes to working with acoustic drum samples, the advantages of using commercial software like EZdrummer, Addictive Drums, or BFD2 are more than obvious. But not everyone can afford these, as they all come with quite a big price tag. These virtual instruments are available in multiple formats, they feature loads of velocity layers, but they also come with a price tag. You could always get yourself a cheaper alternative like the Premier Outfits Kit by Drumdrops for example, but sometimes even a small amount of money is too much.

There was a time when retail stock outflows were considered a bullish catalyst: after all, retail was always considered the dumb money (not "two and twenty" hedge funds which continue to underperform the stock market, and have done so for the past five years), and would pull money at the bottom and add money at the top. This is no longer the case for the simple reason that while persistent outflows from domestic equity funds continue (and as the recent shuttering of levered ETFs by Direxion shows the infatuation with synthetic mutual fund replacements is now over), for the inverse to be true there have to be inflows, which are now non-existent. In the past two years, or 106 weeks of market data, there here been 17 weeks of inflows, or 16% of the total, amounting to $31 billion. The remainder? Outflows for a total of $300 billion. In the 32 weeks of YTD 2012 money flows, there have been 5 weeks of inflows for a total of $3.6 billion (which was also equal to the outflow in the last week alone) none of which coincided with market tops, and in fact the biggest outflows occurred just as the market hit interim highs. The most recent inflow, as tiny as it may have been, curious occurred during the May lows, proving retail is if anything, the smart money now. In other words, those looking for hints about the market based on retail flows are advised to look elsewhere. What this data does show is that no matter what happens in the stock market, the outflows will persist and are unlikely to reverse direction. Because if the S&P at fresh 2012 (and multi-year) highs is unable to draw retail out of hibernation, nothing will. Where is the money flowing? Why into fixed income of course, proving that as far as the now extinct investor class is concerned, return of capital is the only thing that matters, while HFTs and prop trading desks can fight over all the return on capital scraps provided courtesy of the Chairman. Curious where the volume has gone? Now you know.

"Let's be clear, when Mr. Ryan says 'inner city,' when he says, 'culture,' these are simply code words for what he really means: 'black.'"

It also marks yet another example nationwide of lawlessness leading to more lawlessness and the negative impact illegal immigration is having on taxpayers.

So, the good news is that I still have time to finish this project by the end of the day on Wednesday. The bad news, of course, is that I had about a two-day-long funk last week that has put me pretty far behind where I'd intended to be by this point. This was compounded over the weekend by family obligations and the fatigue brought on by my allergies when I'm pretty sure literally every tree in my town bloomed at once. It's pretty, and the whole town smells like flowers, but it makes me feel like I'm going to die. However, today I've got some non-drowsy allergy meds in me and I'm feeling productive, so I expect to get, well, not caught up, quite, but close.

You sometime hear people claiming that their ideas for a film would easily make hundreds of millions of dollars if only they could get past the gatekeepers of the film industry and finally find the finance to produce their films and/or to get them in front of a mainstream audience. Let us get past the fact that ideas need to be first developed into screenplays, that the screenplay needs to attract creatives and financiers, that these people need to actually produce a film, a film that distributors will be comfortable marketing to the 'mainstream audience and that predicting what a wide audience wants to see can be almost considered to be a supernatural power, and let us concentrate on the gatekeepers. Who are they?

With a huge demographic dividend and lower wage rates compared to exporters in Southeast Asia and China, India definitely has an advantage on this count. Modi government's Make in India programme is also meant to propel India into the trajectory of a manufacturing exporter.

A man interviewed by Bill O'Reilly by Bill O'Reilly on Fox News this week , who was identified in an on-screen caption as a "Swedish Defense and National Security Advisor," turns out to be entirely unknown in his native country, with no connections to either the nation's defense or security services. As the Swedish newspaper Dagens Nyheter reported on Friday, Nils Bildt, who echoed President Donald Trump's debunked claim that immigrants from Muslim-majority nations had driven a rise in violent crime in Sweden, has no known expertise in national security, and has not lived in his homeland since 1994. Officials at the Swedish Defense Ministry and Foreign Office told the newspaper they had never heard of this "unknown Bildt."
A few years ago, when I was 58, I had a secret that I couldn't discuss with anyone: I was still a virgin. How I arrived at that age with my virginity intact probably isn't that unusual from many men in the same situation. In high school I was painfully shy and, with one exception, the few girls I got the courage to ask out declined my invitations. I never happened to meet a lady that I truly wanted to pursue in college, so I again gave into my shyness and never asked anyone out. Because of this by the time I turned 21, I had never had a real girlfriend.

ADMAT 2.0 Many scientific computing tasks require the repeated computation of derivatives. Hand-coding of derivative functions can be tedious, complex, and error-prone. Moreover, the computation of first and second derivatives, and sometimes the Newton step, is often a dominant part in a scientific computing code. Derivative approximations such as finite-differencing involve additional errors and heuristic choice of parameters. This toolbox is designed to help a MATLAB user compute first and second derivatives and related structures efficiently, accurately, and automatically. ADMAT 2.0 TM employs many sophisticated techniques such as exploiting sparsity and structure to achieve high efficiency in computing derivative structures including gradients, Jacobians, and Hessians. Moreover, ADMAT 2.0 can directly calculate Newton steps for nonlinear systems, often with great efficiency. A MATLAB user needs only to provide an M-file that evaluates a smooth nonlinear objective function at a given point. On request and when appropriate, ADMAT 2.0 will evaluate the Jacobian matrix (for which the gradient is a special case), the Hessian matrix, and possibly the Newton step in addition to the evaluation of the objective function at the given point. There is no need for the user to provide code for derivative calculation or an approximation scheme. Please use the following link to download ADMAT 2.0 from us. ADMAT 2.0 is available free of charge for up to one year . Click the following link to download the ADMAT 2.0 trial version Please click here to obtain a compact guide and a comprehensive guide for using ADMAT 2.0 ADMAT 2.0 includes the following functionalities: 1. Forward mode for first order derivative computation 2. Reverse mode for first order derivative computation 3. Mechanisms and procedures for combining automatic differentiation of M-files with the finite differencing approximation for MEX files 4. Efficient evaluation of sparse Jacobians and sparse Hessians 5. Computation of the sparsity structure of Jacobians and Hessians 6. A template design for the efficient calculation of 'structured' Jacobian and Hessian matrices 7. Efficient direct computation of Newton steps while avoiding the full computation of the Jacobian and/or Hessian matrix when appropriate 8. Support of the MATLAB Optimization Toolbox with ADMAT 9.

Millennials are the only age group in America in which a majority views socialism favorably. A national Reason-Rupe survey found that 53 percent of Americans under 30 have a favorable view of socialism compared with less than a third of those over 30. Moreover, Gallup has found that an astounding 69 percent of millennials say they'd be willing to vote for a "socialist" candidate for president - among their parents' generation, only a third would do so. Indeed, national polls and exit polls reveal about 70 to 80 percent of young Democrats are casting their ballots for presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who calls himself a "democratic socialist."

"We strive to lift the voices of the families and communities impacted by all murdered and missing Native women and girls," said Simpson. "It is an abomination that many times the only searches for our missing women are organized by family and friends, and not law enforcement. We aim to raise awareness and increase justice on a national level. But our work must not focus merely on improving the official response when a Native woman or girl is missing. We must restore our women to a place of honor, respect and sacredness so that these crimes can finally end."

There are some rockin new Citizens of Thingiverse: The Hives! Read below to hear why we think this is cool, but for now here's the skinny. This Swedish band has been making energetic, makes-you-jump-around rock music (yes, the first sentence was a pun) since 1993, and in many people's view keeping rock music alive. When the guys took some time out of their crazy schedule to visit our headquarters in Brooklyn, we did not miss the opportunity to. The amazing people at Baeble Music documented the whole thing on their site and in the video below, which is basically a day in the life with The Hives. Enjoy the whole interview or jump to the 9:40 mark to see the MakerBot section. It's a little sped up, yes, but the scanning really is that simple. We do a lot of this at our office and on the road because all we need to bring is a laptop, a Microsoft Kinect, and a spinny chair. Check here for more info about this method of On their brand new Thingiverse page, just launched today, these world famous rockstars have shared their heads with you to use them as you please. And if you're a big fan, remember that our Todd Blatt also uploaded a Hives version of one of his sweet custom guitar picks! Find it here . To reiterate how cool this is: this is super cool. The Hives have listed all of their upcoming tour dates on their Thingiverse page , and now you can download scans of the guys themselves before you go to a show. Maybe you'll turn the scans into a set of Pez dispensers, or keychains, or some other brilliant thing to show off to other concert goers. Maybe you'll be the first to make these scans into dualstrusion files, so you can showcase this band in their trademark black-and-white getups. Stay tuned for more sweet Thingiverse action from The Hives!
In 1989 Ellen Stohl, who had become a wheelchair user after a car accident, appeared in an eight-page spread in Playboy magazine. She had pushed to do so, she explained later, because it was important for her to express her right to sexuality. "Sexuality is the hardest thing for a disabled person to hold on to," she said in a TV interview. "I am a woman more than a wheelchair."

Thousands of families are visiting Galveston Island for spring break, and some of them were in for a big surprise.A couple of fisherman in a boat caught a shark, measured it and released it a few blocks west of 61st Street.A Houston mom visiting Galveston with her son captured the incident on video with her cell phone Wednesday. We showed families at the beach."Surprising. You have to be careful and don't go all the way outside." Her grandfather Bruce Ishem said, "They were asking if there were sharks here, they are from Oklahoma," little girl Jaiden Hill said.It's something many families say they've thought about before. The beach patrol says it's not unusual."It's very concerning, yes ma'am. We didn't get in the water this trip because we didn't bring bathing suits down. I think next time we might be a little more careful," mother Amy Mouton, of Cypress, said.Galveston Island Beach Patrol Chief Peter Davis says an actual bite is very rare in Galveston noting."There are sharks in the Gulf," Davis said. "Anytime you're in the water you want to shuffle your feet unless you're in a big hurry. That sends a vibration that lets baby fish, catfish, stingray all the stuff you don't want to mix with, they'll get out of your way if they know you're there," said Davis.The fishermen measured the shark and then threw it back into the water to cheers. It is exactly the advice of one of the youngest beachgoers we talked too."I would let it be back in because I'm an animal lover, and I don't want it to die and it would bite me," little Adelei Mouton said.
"Deputy Secretary of Public Safety and Homeland Security Adam Thiel has been dispatched to the scene and will provide my team and me with constant updates as this situation unfolds," the governor said in a statement.

Scientists have developed a new method of replacing missing teeth with a bioengineered material generated from a person's own gum cells. Current implant-based methods of whole tooth replacement fail to reproduce a natural root structure and as a consequence of the friction from eating and other jaw movement, loss of jaw bone can occur around the implant. The research is led by Professor Paul Sharpe, an expert in craniofacial development and stem cell biology at King's College London and published in the Journal of Dental Research.
Pope Francis spent the weekend in and around Mexico's capital highlighting issues such as corruption, and the failure of the Mexican Church hierarchy to do enough about the suffering caused by the country's drug wars.

Few academic ideas have been as eagerly absorbed into public discourse in recent years as "implicit bias." Embraced by a president, a would-be president, and the nation's top law-enforcement official, the implicit-bias conceit has launched a movement to remove the concept of individual agency from the law and spawned a multimillion-dollar consulting industry. The statistical basis on which it rests is now crumbling, but don't expect its influence to wane anytime soon.

Swedish film-maker Roy Andersson was an internationally renowned cult figure, best known for his handful of short films and innovative television commercials -- even described by Ingmar Bergman as the best in the world. After a 25 year gap (made "Gilliap" in 1975), he returned with a surrealistic black comedy, "Songs from the Second Floor" (2000), which revolved around the upcoming millennium.   Partially self-financed, the film was in production for four years and the end product resembles a Kubrickian, evident especially in Andersson's overweening perfection. Every shot in the film indicates control and precision. Despite the precise look and original vision, the film has no script or story to speak of.

While more research is needed on the scope of human trafficking, below are a few key statistics:

Our Sister Republics is a book about the history of the United States and its relations with Central and South America in the early 19th century by history professor Caitlin Fitz. The book discusses the popular sentiment in favor of revolutions against Spanish and Portuguese control in Latin America following the War of 1812, which turned sour after 1826 as the new republics suffered civil unrest and incompetent governance while the United States turned toward racialist nationalism.
