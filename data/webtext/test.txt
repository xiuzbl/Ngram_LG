Intro "In his search for food, early man tried all kinds of plants. Some nourished him, some, he found cured his ills, and some killed him. Few, to his surprise, had strange effects on his mind and body, seeming to carry him onto other worlds. We call these plants hallucinogens, because they distort the senses and usually produce hallucinations--experiences that depart from reality. Although most hallucinations are visual, they may also involve the senses of hearing, touch, smell, or taste--and occasionally several senses simultaneously..."

Take a look at some of the last images ever taken of the Owings Mills Mall.

Last week, London-based fashion label KTZ were in hot water over the "Shaman Towelling Sweatshirt" featured in their AW15 collection – a design which Salome Awa says was copied from her great-grandfather Aua, one of the last Shaman of the Canadian Inuit.

The Obama administration is being slammed from all sides for its failing strategy against ISIS—and rightly so.

Namely: Does ISIS actually win even when it loses?

Those top-round picks, there still is an awful lot of fallout."

If you haven't been paying attention: Republicans have been so gung-ho about stripping health care from millions of people and giving tax cuts to a few monstrously rich people that at the end of September they needlessly let the Children's Health Plan (CHIP) expire - just like too many kids and adults s will if the GOP can't figure out how to act like human beings, and govern accordingly. Currently, CHIP provides health care to almost nine million children nationwide; if Congress, which has historically summoned a reasonable facsimile of bi-partisan support for what most normal people would consider a basic human need, can't find the will to reauthorize it in the next few weeks, at least 16 states will run out of funding by January 1.

Most economists agree that advances in robotics and AI over the next few decades are likely to lead to significant job losses. But what's less often considered is how these changes could also impact social mobility. A new report from UK charity Sutton Trust explains the danger, noting that unless governments take action, the next wave of automation will dramatically increase inequality within societies, further entrenching the divide between rich and poor.

There are, as the cops would say, several facts "pertaining" to Mr Khan's kidnapping. Firstly, his son Hafiz Zaenullah, his brother Asif Iqbal and another man – a stonemason called Khaliq Dad – were killed by a drone attack on Mr Khan's home in December 2009. Secondly, he had filed a legal case in Pakistan against the American drone strikes, arguing that they constituted murder under domestic law. And thirdly – perhaps Mr Khan's most serious crime – he was about to leave for Brussels to address European Union parliamentarians on the dangers of American drone strikes in Pakistan.

Django or Drupal for Content Management: Which Fits your Needs? If you're building or updating a website, you're probably wondering about which content management system (CMS) to use. A CMS helps users — particularly non-technical users — to add pages and blog posts, embed videos and images, and incorporate other content into their site. CMS options You could go with something quick and do-it-yourself, like WordPress (read more about WordPress) or a drag-and-drop builder like Squarespace. If you need greater functionality, like user account management or asset tracking, or if you're concerned about security and extensibility, you'll need a more robust CMS. That means using a framework to build a complex website that can manage large volumes of data and content. Wait, what's a framework? Put simply, a framework is a library of reusable code that is easily edited by a web developer to produce custom products more quickly than coding everything from scratch. Django and Drupal are both frameworks with dedicated functionality for content management, but there is a key difference between them: Drupal combines aspects of a web application framework with aspects of a CMS Django separates the framework and the CMS The separation that Django provides makes it easier for content managers to use the CMS because ...

Before we get into the deliciousness above, let me thank you all for making this year's NEDA week post—sharing your ED story with a partner or friend—so lovely.

Ok, so this is a fairly short and not all too in-depth TL;DR this week for a couple of reasons. 1) If you watched our Music Monday on B.A.P.'s "Power" you'd remember that Martina lost her voice. It's still lost. Slowly coming back, but she sounds like a 439 year old witch whose lungs are made of dust. So, I had to do this TL;DR by myself. Also 2) I'm kinda sick. Not voice-losing sick, but coughing up randomly and uncontrollably. So, the less talking the better. Kinda can't do that when your only job is to talk on camera! Ah! So, like the shorter and easier Music Monday, we've got a shorter and easier TL;DR.

What IT: Chapter 2 Should Do With The Book's Most Psychedelic Parts, According To Bill Skarsgard By Eric Eisenberg Random Article Blend SPOILER WARNING: The following article contains certain spoilers about the end of Stephen King's IT, and therefore potential spoilers for the developing IT: Chapter 2. If you have not read the book, and don't wish to know how it all ends, please bookmark this page and save it until you're ready to read! Prior to Andres Muscheitti's film, there were a few reasons why Stephen King's IT was considered unadaptable in the medium, and only one of them was the extreme length of the story. Another is the fact that the end of the book winds up getting extremely trippy and weird in its third act, with both the kids and adults' storylines leading to confrontation with the titular monster on an inter-dimensional battlefield. Obviously this element was entirely left out of the recently released movie, but star Bill Skarsgard really wants to see IT: Chapter 2 fully embrace it. Discussing the nature and mind of Pennywise in the novel, he recently said, It's hardly answered in the novel, either. I mean, it's very abstract. And I kind of like that. It could be almost a sort of surrealistic sort of psychedelic trip if you go into the mind of Pennywise. And if you've read the novel you know that they do actually go into his mind. Or they go into this trans-dimensional place, and they sort of beat him in this place. Which might be interesting, what that place would be, and what would it look like. There's opportunities, I think, and I'm excited for it. Bill Skarsgard is currently promoting his second Stephen King adaptation of 2017, the new Hulu series Castle Rock, but while speaking with IGN at New York Comic-Con this past weekend he also took the time to talk about what he would like to see in IT: Chapter 2. The actor was asked about the possibility of the sequel delving deeper into his monstrous character's mind, and Skarsgard noted that he thinks there are some fantastic visual opportunities to explore with that idea in the source material. In the novel, there are a couple chapters that dive into the nature of Pennywise, and it's revealed that he is an ancient, interdimensional entity who feeds on fear for sustenance so that he can last through his 27-year hibernation periods. Defeating IT requires the fight being brought to ITs own home turf - in a "ceremony" called The Ritual of Chud - and how it's described in the book would be a sincere challenge to directly adapt on screen. The Losers Club performs the Ritual of Chud when they are both children and adults, but just because it wasn't featured in Andres Muschietti's IT doesn't mean that it won't wind up in IT: Chapter 2. In fact, Bill Skarsgard argues that the sequel actually should be a very different film, as what scares children and what scares adults are two very different things, and that deserves exploration. Said Skarsgard, The first movie worked so well at what it is trying to do, I think, and ultimately that is the kids' story, and you follow these kids and you sort of fall in love with these kids. And the second one will be the adult story. And I think the right way to do it is to make that movie actively different. ... I think there might be worth exploring sort of the psychological aspects of horror, but also maybe the sort of cosmological existence of this being. What is he, and where does he come from? When didn't actually know when we would be getting IT: Chapter 2 for what felt like a long time to an impatient mind - but that mystery was solved a few weeks back.

[Updated 4/2/2007 - follow-up article here] For the last three years, I've been meaning to put to rest once and for all the urban legends and myths on wireless LAN security. Every time I write an article or blog on wireless LAN security, someone has to come along and regurgitate one of these myths. If that weren't bad enough, many "so called" security experts propagated these myths through speaking engagements and publications and many continue to this day. Many wireless LAN equipment makers continue to recommend many of these schemes to this day. One would think that the fact that none of these schemes made it in to the official IEEE 802.11i security standard would give a clue to their effectiveness, but time and time again that theory is proven wrong. To help you avoid the these schemes, I've created the following list of the six dumbest ways to secure your wireless LAN.
A LOT has changed since our last update.. Anthony got MARRIED to the love of his life (we love her to death)! Watch their beautiful wedding video here:vimeo.com/112371211We are fundraising money, because Anthony is not working anymore & is taking care of his health & spending time with family full time. On average, ALS patient care can be upwards of $200K a year. Although Anthony is currently not at that point of dependency, ALS only gets worse & is a progressive disease...we know it too well. This is why we're attempting to prepare for a financially stress free life.Anthony will ultimately need a wheelchair accessible home... he will need help paying for health insurance, future medical expenses, food, phone, car, rent, basic living costs... etc and hopefully a little room to enjoy his healthier years...We sincerely appreciate any and all support. We love each and every one of you! Words can not describe how incredibly grateful our family is for your support... today and always.How do I contact Anthony?Letters of encouragement:31915 Rancho California Road, Suite 200-400, Temecula CA, 92591Instagram - http://www.instagram.com/carbajalphoto twitter: @carbajalphotoemail: Anthony@AnthonyCarbajal.comALS research organization we support:ALS Therapy Development Institute - www.ALS.net ...............................................................................................................Anthony Carbajal is an AMAZING human being.Anthony is kind-hearted, generous and an inspiration to us all. He radiates joy, love and compassion. He loves to laugh, takes the most gorgeous photographs, has mad skateboarding skills, plays the acoustic guitar and is an artist at heart. He is LOVED by all, and he is a miraculous gift to our family and everyone else who knows him.On Monday, January 27th, Anthony received the devastating news that he has ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. ALS runs in the family. His grandmother died from it, and his mother currently has it. Ironically, Anthony had been helping to take care of his mother and is a dedicated advocate and voice in the fight to cure ALS when this all happened. In his own words:"During the past six months, my hands became noticeably weaker, and both arms began twitching constantly. My last few weddings, I had difficulties changing my camera settings, because my hands were so weak. I tried to convince myself it was carpal tunnel, even though I knew these were the same symptoms my mother and grandmother experienced before they were diagnosed with ALS. I finally got health insurance and was seen by a neurologist. I was diagnosed soon after."To attempt to preserve the muscle that's left in his hands and arms, he can no longer work as a wedding photographer. The equipment is too heavy, and the days are too long. Once muscle is lost, it cannot be regained, and the risk is not worth it. He is liquidating his camera equipment to raise funds to pay for his medical insurance and costs, as well as his business expenses and taxes that he currently owes, but it will not be enough since he can no longer work... So, we are fundraising for him. All contributions go directly into Anthony's PayPal account, and you do not need a PayPal account to contribute. When the payment request comes up, you have the option to use PayPal or credit card.Share & contribute through this website. - or –Mail a check to his address:31915 Rancho California Road, Suite 200-400, Temecula CA, 92591Spread the word about ALS and/or pray for him.Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects nerve cells in the brain and the spinal cord. Motor neurons reach from the brain to the spinal cord and from the spinal cord to the muscles throughout the body. The progressive degeneration of the motor neurons in ALS eventually leads to their death. When the motor neurons die, the ability of the brain to initiate and control muscle movement is lost. With voluntary muscle action progressively affected, patients in the later stages of the disease may become totally paralyzed.

According to court documents, Ripple entered the bank and handed the teller a note demanding money and saying that he had a gun.But after the bank teller handed over several thousand dollars in cash, Ripple didn't flee the scene -- he sat down and waited for police to arrive and arrest him.An FBI agent revealed in court that Ripple had argued with his wife earlier, telling her that he'd rather be in jail than with her. Authorities say he wrote her a note saying he "no longer wanted to be in that situation."Ripple faces up to 20 years in federal prison and a fine of up to $250,000.The Kansas City Star reports that Ripple's wife accompanied him to court Monday.

2) Budget a LOT of time. I'm sure experienced swatchers can do this more quickly, but it took me roughly 30 - 45 minutes per colour to do the full swatching/clean up/picture editing/posting on the blog. For the 11 colours I did, I spent about 4 hours on polish, and 2 - 3 hours on photo editing and posting. That's a LOT of work!

After all, President Obama is no pushover.

On an earlier occasion, he overruled his entire national security team's proposal to arm and train the Syrian opposition. For better or worse, American intervention in Libya was Mr. Obama's decision, not Mrs. Clinton's. It is called the Obama administration for a reason.

As a human species we tend to have an explosive curiosity for the world around us. I feel it is what makes us unique, and probably is what makes humans the dominant species. I was in the store the other day and I overheard someone else's child making the inquiring "why" repeatedly. I have to admit I often ask the question why in my own life, it's what drove me to study science. However, it's the obsession with the "why" that also causes us to sometimes think irrationally. There are absolute truths in the universe, but what makes something true? Often times we have our minds set so much on the "why" that we miss the entire "what" and "how". I feel the one absolute truth (no matter what you believe) is that we have no idea what absolute truth and knowledge is.

A recent survey found that 67% of the Americans polled had a favorable view of Microsoft. It's too bad the question was so vague, I'd like to know if that same percentage trusts Microsoft without any reservations. In general, the coverage of the court findings in the Microsoft case have not mentioned any of the facts that led Judge Jackson to rule against Microsoft. So I thought it might be a good idea to go over some of the specific allegations against Microsoft that have been ignored in most discussions. Rather than going through them all, and there are plenty, I'll concentrate most on Microsoft's campaign to squash an one of their competitors in the early 1990's, Digital Research Inc. To set the scene, I'd like to take a stroll down memory lane. As someone who lived through this seemingly early phase in computer history, I am recalling this from memory, so bear with me. Back in the days when computers were not rated solely by MHz, but also by which Intel processor they had in them, a single office might have "286", "386" and "486" computers in them all at the same time. Windows 2.something was out, and it ran on top of DOS 4. At that time, basically the early 1990's, Windows was not a clear standard operating system. However, it was a step in the right direction, and it ran neatly on top of DOS (disk operating system), which was the operating system that all PCs used back then. IBM had a faltering version of DOS (IBM DOS), Microsoft has it's version (MS DOS), and a new star on the scene, Digital Research Inc., had come up with a new and improved version of DOS, known as DR DOS. The problem with DOS back then was the infamous 640Kb memory barrier, and how to use extended or expanded memory for applications larger than 640Kb. There was a heck of a lot of idle memory in PCs at that time, and people were looking for ways to use that extra memory, other than setting up a "RAM-drive". Digital Research was about to release a new version of DOS, "DR DOS 6", and Microsoft was very worried. According to Microsoft's own documents and internal email messages, DR DOS 5 was a superior product to their own upcoming "MS DOS 5", it was cheaper, and it would be out first. At that point, they began a campaign to flood the information channels with hype about MS DOS 5, and how it had advanced memory management, and was superior to all other products. This is standard business practice, but what followed, as outlined in Microsoft's own internal documents and memos, went far beyond that. Microsoft released MS DOS 5 in 1991 and Windows 3.1 in 1992. They were both big hits. DR DOS 6 was coming out, and was considered a superior product by many power users, and sold well. Then owners of DR DOS started getting error messages when they tried to install Windows 3.1 on their systems. It turns out that the developers of Windows were instructed to "make sure DR DOS has problems with Windows". The following are selected Microsoft emails that were entered into evidence in the trial. Microsoft's David Cole emailed Phil Barrett on September 30 1991: "It's pretty clear we need to make sure Windows 3.1 only runs on top of MS DOS or an OEM version of it," and "The approach we will take is to detect DR DOS 6 and refuse to load. The error message should be something like 'Invalid device driver interface." Microsoft had several methods of detecting and sabotaging DR-DOS with Windows. One was to have Smartdrive detect DR-DOS and refused to load it for Windows 3.1. There was also a version check in XMS in the Windows 3.1 setup program which produced the message: "The XMS driver you have installed is not compatible with Windows. You must remove it before setup can successfully install Windows." This was not true, but rather, was an attempt to undermine the competition. Brad Silverberg, the Microsoft exec who had been responsible for Windows 95, emailed Jim Allchin (now Senior Vice President of MS) on September 27th 1991: "after IBM announces support for dr-dos at comdex, it's a small step for them to also announce they will be selling netware lite, maybe sometime soon thereafter. but count on it. We don't know precisely what ibm is going to announce. my best hunch is that they will offer dr-dos as the preferred solution for 286, os 2 2.0 for 386. they will also probably continue to offer msdos at $165 (drdos for $99). drdos has problems running windows today, and I assume will have more problems in the future." Jim Allchin replied: "You should make sure it has problems in the future. :-)". Andy Hill emailed David Cole, Windows group manager: "Janine has brought up some good questions on how we handle the error messages that the users will get if they aren't using MS-DOS.

Kass McQuillen stands in the jungle with Tasha Fox, holding a hatchet in one hand, and Spencer Bledsoe's life in the other. They are debating what to do with his future. Tribal Council looms, and the two Luzon women must make a call: Cut Spencer, the challenge asset they don't trust, or cut J'Tia Taylor, the challenge disaster they do trust. Tasha agonizes over the decision, unsure of which way to turn, so much so that she'll still question the call later that night at Tribal. For Kass? It's whatever. She does not care if the hatchet falls on Spencer. She does not care if the hatchet falls on J'Tia. She just wants to bury the hatchet and move on. "To me, just make a decision, and live with it," the California-based attorney says, describing the situation. "But that's my life. I have to make decisions for people and live with them all the time. Am I the hatchet man for J'Tia or Spencer? I can live with either decision. Either one is the same gamble for me, because I can't predict what's going to happen tomorrow." This is how Kass views Survivor. Cut this person, cut that person, cut all of the persons, as long as you're cutting forward. But she believes people view her as someone who cuts aimlessly. "The public perception is that I'm an idiot," she tells me on the day before Survivor: Cambodia — Second Chance begins. "That's great, because I personally know that I'm not. Every move I made was the only thing I could do to further my game." I don't know how many of the Second Chancers view Kass as an idiot, but I do know that several of them view her as dangerous, unpredictable, and at least a little bit terrifying. Exhibit A: Stephen Fishbach. "She scares me," he tells me a couple of hours after my chat with Kass. "She seems so rational and funny and smart, but uniformly I have heard that she's erratic and vindictive." There are many pop culture touchstones one can use to describe Kass McQuillen, one of the single most iconic villains of the modern Survivor era. Lucy yanking the ball away from Charlie Brown is the one we hear the most. It's a fairly innocuous comparison, but there are more merciless metaphors to explore.

One of the longest-running horror film series began with this gory shocker from director Sean S. Cunningham, who had previously produced Wes Craven's classic Last House on the Left. Entrepreneur Steve Christie (Peter Brouwer) re-opens Camp Crystal Lake after many years during which it has been cursed by murders and bad luck. The young and nubile counselors all begin to die extremely bloody deaths at the hands of an unseen killer during a rainstorm which isolates the camp. A woman is chopped in the face with an axe, another has her throat sliced in amazingly gruesome fashion, a male counselor (Harry Crosby) is pinned to a door with arrows, and a young Kevin Bacon has an arrow shoved through his throat from below a bed. Victor Miller's script is not particularly impressive, but Cunningham's tense direction, and some remarkable special-effects by acclaimed makeup artist Tom Savini are enough to make it worthwhile. 1950s quiz show regular Betsy Palmer appears as the cook whose son, Jason (Ari Lehman), drowned 25 years earlier while neglected by romancing counselors. Palmer was reportedly cast because she was willing to drive her own car to and from the set. Trivia buffs should note the decapitation scene near the end, in which the female killer exhibits rather hirsute hands clutching at the air. The hands belong to Savini's assistant, Taso N. Stavrakis. Friday the 13th made nearly 40 million dollars at the box office and spawned numerous sequels. ~ Robert Firsching, Rovi
John Milius's jingoistic direction and pulpy screenplay fit perfectly into this film version of the Robert E. Howard fantasy story of the sword and sorcery hero, Conan the Barbarian. Complementing Mulius's heavy metal production is Arnold Schwarzenegger's leaden acting, which in any other context would be deadly, but here (as in The Terminator) corresponds nicely with the whole sonorous project. The story begins when a horde of rampaging warriors massacre the parents of young Conan and enslave the young child for years on The Wheel of Pain. The Wheel of Pain seems to have as its only purpose the building up of Conan's muscles, so it's no surprise that one day Conan grows up to become Arnold Schwarzenegger. As the sole survivor of the childhood massacre, Conan is released from slavery and taught the ancient arts of fighting. Transforming himself into a killing machine, Conan travels into the wilderness to seek vengeance on Thulsa Doom (James Earl Jones), the man responsible for killing his family. In the wilderness, Conan takes up with the thieves Valeria (Sandahl Bergman) and Subota (Gerry Lopez). The trio comes upon a weird snake cult, linked to Doom, and Conan wants to trek off to Doom's mountain retreat to kill him. But he is prevented from doing that by King Osrik (Max Von Sydow), who wants the trio of warriors to help rescue his daughter who has joined Doom in the hills. ~ Paul Brenner, Rovi

Since then, the principality's mild climate, splendid scenery, and gambling facilities have made Monaco world famous as a tourist and recreation center.
Over the last two weeks, U.S. President Donald Trump has attacked Syria without congressional approval, ratcheted up the use of force in Afghanistan with a huge bomb, and moved to reverse the Obama administration's policy of releasing White House visitor logs. Each of these actions runs completely counter to the views and values once espoused by Trump on Twitter. And they join an amazingly long — and growing — list of old Trump tweets that have become eerily applicable to Trump's own presidency in ways that scream "hypocrisy."

Monday, January 11th, 2016 will forever be equated with the day that our Aliyah ended. After ten years of building a life for ourselves, ingraining our family into a community and integrating into Israeli life, one miserable eye-opening day made us question our decision to live out our lives in Zion and take stock as to why we are really here. Whether we move back is inconsequential, what matters here is that the belief we held in the State of Israel was demolished with the reality that the land we live in is not free nor just and without major reforms it never will be for the millions of people who call this place home.

NEW DELHI: Four proposed power sub-stations which can end electricity crisis in the national capital have failed to see the light of day as land has not been allocated to even one of them by Delhi government, Power Minister Piyush Goyal said today.The Minister said once these four substations at Rajghat, Tughlakabad, Dwarka and Karampura are ready, the Centre could bring in 7,400 MW of power to Delhi, which is substantially higher than estimated demand even in the next few years."I met the Power Minister of Delhi Satyendra Jain and he agreed to resolve the matter, and ensure land availability by working with all stakeholders."I am hopeful that the land will be allotted to PGCIL on mutually agreeable terms expeditiously and work will begin at the earliest, so that people of Delhi are not forced to suffer power cuts in future," Goyal said in a blog written by him on completion of one year as the Union Power Minister.Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) plans to construct four 400/220 KV power substations each of capacity 2000 MVA at Rajghat, Tughlakabad, Dwarka and Karampura, "but land has not been allotted land for even one of them," Goyal said.The Union Minister added that he had to face power crisis in Delhi just three days after assuming the charge and even his residence did not have power in night at that time last year. AAP had abdicated its responsibility in government, and we could not see Delhi and Delhiites suffer the ignominy of the National Capital being out of power. Hence we immediately swung into action and took up restoration activities on a war-footing..." he said.After handling the power crisis, the Centre started working on "inverter and generator-mukt Delhi", Goyal said and added the Power Ministry subsequently finalised and started implementing a Rs 7,791 crore plan for upgradation of the city's power systems for "a robust, reliable and secure transmission infrastructure for the long-term".
"We just can't have everybody in the intelligence community, they have such power to suck up every bit of every transmission, every communication we ever made, we can't just have them willy-nilly releasing that to the public," Paul said on "Fox & Friends."

That's certainly a possibility. Most of the slab is clearly runes. About half were ones I was pretty confident on before consulting anything.But working through I noticed that some appeared to be backwards or inverted. But then I decided to check different eras for the runes and found a few matches I didn't expect. Even still, there's several that look like they "fit" in regards to style etc. but no one has any matches.Which does open up the possibility that more than one region's "alphabet" is in play at the same time.I should clarify a thought I kinda failed to expand on in my first post. I decided to attempt to translate as there's a few instances of repeat runes. The idea being that if they were intended to convey the more symbolic meanings (ice, elk, etc.) then I'd expect symbols not to repeat. Sort of like the runes are carved as blessing. The blessing of isaz or ice would only be transcribed once for instance.I have two alternative theories that could help this make sense:It could be a recorded history, in which the runes at the beginning are "older" than the last line. This would explain the changing style. It might not even be a history lesson, but as the slab is passed down, a new "blessing" or rune is added. In the latter case, a coherent message would be unlikely.Alternatively, it could be sort of like a picture story. Each rune represents the symbolic meaning and is intended to convey a story. So like the first line might have something to do with an ice elkFrom what I have, that would be:Yew Tree*, wealth/cattle, elk, ???, joy, need**???, Sun**, ???, ulcer/torch, Sun, Ice, Need, SunIce, wealth/cattle, year/good year (harvest), man, Tiwaz (a god generally better knows as "Tyr"), Ice*From quick research Yggdrasill might have been a yew tree. Seems interesting to say the least. However, this rune would need another line at the top (heading down and right) to be that rune for sure. It looks incomplete, but with the lower line the "waz" rune looked closest and it's hard to tell if that top line might have been started. Otherwise, "ice" might be reasonable as well.**This one also looks to be possibly incomplete or defaced, so "need" is the best guess I have***This rune could be a separate one or part of the first one on the second lineAssuming I have any of this right, it's interesting thematically. We could have a beginning of "tree," some references to nature, joy and need (driving forces/motivations). This is followed by what could be cyclic use of the word "sun" which as we all should know makes some sense. And it ends some repetition of ice, possible images of bounty (wealth/cattle and good year/harvest) followed by the rune for man, a god known for bravery and wisdom and ending with ice.EDIT: The "elk" rune later turned into the one for man (and changed letters). It is also associated with life.EDIT EDIT: The second rune top line might not be "fehu" or "wealth/cattle." It could also be "berkanan" which means "birch" or other tree associations. So potentially two tree references top line

To this day, I am surprised at the number of people who complain about the Journal's binary storage format. Having spent years working as a system administrator, and after years of working with and on syslog-ng - in the capacity of maintainer of the Open Source Edition for more than a year -, I am increasingly puzzled about all the hostility towards non-text storage formats. I am even more puzzled about the arguments against it. Maybe I'm living in a different world, but there are very, very few reasons I see for using text based storage, when there is a better option available. I've been asked numerous times about my logging needs, and why I am so vigilantly against text based log storage, and this is my attempt at answering those questions.

That is where I had left them and it hadn't entered my head they wouldn't still be there when I got home.

On their third album, the War on Drugs essentially continue to stake out their own particular patch of ground in 21st century rock & roll with an indie bent, nodding in equal parts toward older traditions and newer ones with a difference of two decades in between them, captured right down to the cover art, which is pretty much a companion piece to the art on their second album Future Weather. On the one hand, there's still a sense of world-weary wisdom and lost Americana as such at work from the start, as the extended breakdown toward the end of "Best Night" demonstrates, all silvery guitar jamming and sparkling piano following from Adam Granduciel's reedy singing. At the same time the diffuse qualities of feedback, psychedelic glaze, and textural experimentation via everything that fed into what became shoegaze (not to mention shoegaze itself) remain key, audible in the opening chimes of "Brothers" and "It's Your Destiny"'s spaced-out and exultant flow, perhaps most notably on the short instrumentals "Original Slave" and "Come for It." If the basic balance remains unchanged, the result has been a sound just enough of the War on Drugs' own as a result, which gets stronger and even more droned out and powerful as the album continues. More than once they find just the right way to make it all click into something even more distinct, like the higher-pitched croon on "I Was There" slipping out over a gentle chug underpinned by darker feedback shadings or the Motorik-as-classic-rock-anthem "Come to the City," which practically begs a massive arena/light show performance (little surprise the later instrumental "City Reprise #12" takes that feeling and runs with it even more triumphantly). "Your Love Is Calling My Name" is the album's clearest barnburner, with a brisk, sharp pace and Granduciel riding-the-freeway-referencing lyrics with an appropriate easygoing elan, all while feeling warm and enveloping around the edges (and especially on the great instrumental break leading back into a wonderful, focused guitar part).

'In Meat We Trust' Argues We Got The Meat Industry We Asked For
Ecosystem protection payments pay off Trees take up a lot of CO 2 , so one approach to reducing the rate of increase in atmospheric CO 2 levels is to reduce the cutting down of trees. Jayachandran et al. evaluated a program in which forest owners in Uganda were paid to not cut down their trees. Encouragingly, payments did reduce deforestation, and owners did not compensate by cutting down trees in neighboring forests. Furthermore, even in a scenario where cutting resumed after payments ceased, the beneficial delay in CO 2 release from cut trees, as quantified by the social cost of carbon, outweighed the monetary cost.

Think Progress has really been all over the Florida voter purge story, finally driving the kind of attention to the issue that it deserves. It's really a case of a political party trying to steal an election in plain sight. When you see the head of the Florida Republican Party admit on national television that the purge is based on flawed data, but also that it must continue, you know that the ulterior motives are clear.

Gudiya was six when she went missing from a train in Bihar. The 23-year-old was re-united with her parents in Guwahati, Assam, last week, thanks to an enthusiastic government official and Google search.Gudiya's parents say 17 years ago she was traveling with her uncle in a train from Patna to Guwahati when he got off at a station to buy something to eat and could not board it on time. Gudiya was found alone by railway officials on the train in Guwahati, but she could not tell them who she was.She sent to a children's home, where she was raised. About her life with her parents she could only remember that an uncle worked in a biscuit factory near a railway crossing in front her home in Patna.Neelakshi Sarma, an official of the Assam state child protection society, got close to Gudiya and decided to try and trace her parents. She says she even visited Patna but failed to find them.Ms Sarma then turned to the Google search. "I was searching on Google for hours. One day I got the contact number of a biscuit factory in Patna that help me to trace Gudiya's uncle and finally her parents," she said. When Gudiya went missing she could speak only Hindi; today she knows only Assamese.

Co-opting Narratives of the Other
One of the more common refrains during America's nearly ever-present campaign season is that this election, this year, is the most important of our lives. We documented this in July, noting that it was first used in one form or another back in 1856, but has been common since at least 1980. Why is each election most important? Well, that's often a bit more nebulous.
A bathroom is a perfect platform to showcase your designer and innovative skills and go beyond ordinary or limited. QS Supplies are popular for their trendy, futuristic, designs concepts and have in the past come up with iconic ideas like the Arch overhead Shower and the Zen Rock Basin . With these radiator concepts, the goal was to create a future-ready appliance that can make full use of its designer potential in any setting, domestic or commercial while performing its basic function of warming up a room. The designer's craft rises to meet this challenge in every aspect with each radiator getting the thumbs-up from interior decorators that have been made familiar with these concepts. Although a bit heavy on the pocket, these ideas for modern as well as traditional styled radiators are refreshing and are well worth the money you spend on them.
It's not hard to find North Korea watchers who are critical about the level of effort being made in South Korea to prepare for major change in the DPRK. Although South Korea's Ministry of Unification has in one form or another been tasked with preparing for reunification since 1969, progress towards the once laudable goal has been at best, glacial. And while government initiatives often get tangled in politics, observers say an additional problem now relates to the general public's increasingly apathetic attitudes towards unification.
Irony usually conveys a difference between how things seem to be and the reality.

The recent development of open-source 3-D printers makes scaling of distributed additive-based manufacturing of high-value objects technically feasible and offers the potential for widespread proliferation of mechatronics education and participation. These self-replicating rapid prototypers (RepRaps) can manufacture approximately half of their own parts from sequential fused deposition of polymer feedstocks. RepRaps have been demonstrated for conventional prototyping and engineering, customizing scientific equipment, and appropriate technology-related manufacturing for sustainable development. However, in order for this technology to proliferate like 2-D electronic printers have, it must be economically viable for a typical household. This study reports on the life-cycle economic analysis (LCEA) of RepRap technology for an average US household. A new low-cost RepRap is described and the costs of materials and time to construct it are quantified. The economic costs of a selection of 20 open-source printable designs (representing less than 0.02% of those available), are typical of products that a household might purchase, are quantified for print time, energy, and filament consumption and compared to low and high Internet market prices for similar products without shipping costs. The results show that even making the extremely conservative assumption that the household would only use the printer to make the selected 20 products a year the avoided purchase cost savings would range from about $300 to $2000/year. Assuming the 25 h of necessary printing for the selected products is evenly distributed throughout the year these savings provide a simple payback time for the RepRap in 4 months to 2 years and provide an ROI between >200% and >40%. As both upgrades and the components that are most likely to wear out in the RepRap can be printed and thus the lifetime of the distributing manufacturing can be substantially increased the unavoidable conclusion from this study is that the RepRap is an economically attractive investment for the average US household already. It appears clear that as RepRaps improve in reliability, continue to decline in cost and both the number and assumed utility of open-source designs continues growing exponentially, open-source 3-D printers will become a mass-market mechatronic device.

The larger of the set, meanwhile, has that 34-inch, 3,440 x 1,400 screen, curves with a radius of 1500R and has a 100Hz refresh rate with a 4ms response time.

We were talking for four months every single freaking day; from our interests to how our day went, to our hobbies, favorite colors, beliefs about life, and the Simpsons. We had so many things in common it was scary, and by the end of the first month we had already given ourselves cute little nicknames. It was a tradition that since we lived far away, I would see him every Saturday and sometimes in the middle of the week. We would cuddle in front of his friends, they all knew who I was, "she's mine" he would say, and he even invited me to a family dinner once. I met his parents, dog, and little sister. Everything was perfect and I was so extremely happy how day by day we were growing closer.

I have obtained a copy of Bloomberg's secret "Blueprint for Federal Action on Guns" which is really a blueprint for how the Obama Administration can screw gun owners without needing anything from Congress. Chuck Michel is responsible for filing to FOIA request to get this one out and public where it belongs, [UPDATE: If you want to get the exclusive on this kind of stuff, I would suggest heading over to calgunlaws.com and registering. Their law firm does a lot of cutting edge Second Amendment legal work. It's a great resource.] This was the infamous 40 recommendations that the Washington Post reported on a few months ago. It this document doesn't convince you that MAIG is a significantly more serious threat than any other gun control organization out there, nothing will. Whoever wrote this knows ATF very well, and understands federal gun laws well enough to know how to effectively make changes using only administrative and regulatory changes, which do not require action from the US Congress. While some of the 40 recommendations are not objectionable, quite a number of them are. Let me go down the list and pick out some of the worst offenders, and this is by no means a comprehensive list. Look at the document yourself to find others:

"Hey look, they're gays," one of the attackers allegedly said. Then they badly beat de Bruijn.

After a lengthy absence, the Doctor returns to Earth and scoops up up Amy and Rory for yet another adventure. He also manages somehow to include Rory's dad, Brian Williams. Those aren't the only travelers however as Queen Nefertiti and big-game hunter John Riddell are also on board. The TARDIS next reappears on board a large ship and the Doctor is delighted to find a cargo of prehistoric dinosaurs on board. Using the ship's computers, Amy determines that the ship's crew is nowhere to be found. There is someone on board however who has no intention of giving up his precious cargo to the Doctor or anyone else who might try to take it from him. Written by garykmcd
Yes; to the point that when in 1944 it was proposed to defend against V-2s by using radar and flash-spotting launch warnings to have every heavy AA battery around London fire an intense barrage, in the hope of damaging the incoming missile, it was pointed out that the mass of falling shell splinters would on average kill and wound more civilians than the missile would have, even if they did stop it detonating properly.
The WHO is the world's leading health organisation guiding governments around the world. So we expect their advice to be up to date and evidence-based, particularly on controversial topics. One of the most controversial topics of our time is the international community's approach to drug policy, particularly that relating to the most popular so-called "illegal" drug – cannabis. Yet the WHO's advice on the harms and (lack of) benefits of cannabis is based on a decision made 82 years ago, by its predecessor, the League of Nations. Thankfully, there is now hope that this is about to change.

The Singularity is Nonsense Technological Singularity It's come to my attention that some futurists are still referring to future rapid developments in technology as a "singularity" or a "technological singularity". History Use of the term "the singularity" in this context appears to have originated with the science fiction writer, Vernor Vinge, in 1993. See here for details. Vinge describes the singularity as follows: It is a point where our old models must be discarded and a new reality rules. - http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~phoenix/vinge/vinge-sing.html Problems The problem with using the term "the singularity" is that the phenomena in question doesn't look very singular. We are certainly in the middle of a period of exponential growth - and the rate of progress shows little sign of slowing its rate of increase. However, exponential curves simply don't have "singular" points on them. Look at an exponential curve at any point, and it appears self-similar - no part of it is much different from any other point. The idea of a singularity seems to suggest a sort of super-exponential growth. This diagram - from Ray Kurzweil - illustrates the idea:

Today at the International Consumer Electronics Show 2013 in Las Vegas, modular PC developer� Xi3 �announced�that it had received an investment from Valve Software, and would be working together with the company to produce a new "development stage" product designed with Steam, and its HDTV-friendly Big Picture mode, in mind.Valve has made no secret that it is looking into Steam-friendly hardware that would make PC games friendly for the living room, posing a threat to dedicated game consoles from Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo. This third-party hardware (i.e., it's not produced by Valve itself) is the first Steam-optimized, Valve-backed device to go public.News of the device -- codenamed "Piston" -- arrives shortly after the launch of Nintendo's new Wii U, and during a year when Sony and Microsoft are expected to make their next-gen moves in the video game space."This new development stage product will allow users to take full advantage of their large high-definition TV displays for an amazing computer game experience,"�Xi3 founder Jason A. Sullivan said in a press release (which did not offer pricing details)."As a result, this new system could provide access to thousands of gaming titles through an integrated system that exceeds the capabilities of leading game consoles, but can fit in the palm of your hand."�The prototype will be on display on the show floor at CES this week.�Xi3 had previously attracted attention for its ambitious Kickstarter campaign in late 2012, promising to "usher in the post-PC era." The campaign only received $90,000 of its $250,000 funding goal.

In Brazil, sugar is king. In the field, on the table, on the road – and in the laboratory. The world's largest sugar producer has been fermenting sugar cane juice into ethanol (alcohol) for motor fuel since 1975. For many years, the Brazilian bioethanol programme carried on in virtual isolation from the rest of the world, using fairly low-tech methods. Now, however, Brazil's federal and state governments are pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into research aimed at improving all stages of the bioethanol process, from sugar cane biology to engine efficiency. And the process has become big science, as well as big business.

in before. And his skills keeps growing and growing as the manga proceeds.Story: 9/10Like what was written up there.^ The main character, Shizuku Kanzaki, is a worker in the beer company. Shizuku was never interested in wine before because of his past with them until he heard that his father was dead. His father is a famous food and wine critic. In the story he meets Tomine Issie and they are to compete each other for his father's inheritance. During his struggles, he will notice that the things that his father made him do in the past will help him in the future.Art: 10/10I love the art in here. It has a realistic feeling to it and find it rare to see that in some mangas. The details in here are absolutely amazing. Because of the story, the art describes of the feelings they are having. Not like the type of feeling of sadness or happiness but the feelings like when they smell or taste the wine, what they are imagining. I also like how they make the main guy look so regular and a total amateur at wine, but as something is related to wine, his looks changes to show just how serious and passion he actually has for wine.Character: 8/10Shizuku Kanzaki- The main character who is just a regular beer company worker. He wants to live a regular life and wants nothing with wine. Like a company dog, whenever he meets someone he automatically brings out a company card. His actions toward wine is honest and cute.Tomine Issie- The 'Prince of Wine' and of course, quite popular with the ladies. He is a genius at wine and is supposedly Shizuku's step brother a week before Shizuku's father's death. He competes with the protagonist to gain the inheritance. He's like a typical rival, but of course, we need someone in the story who is good at wine tasting to top it up.Shinohara- We start the manga with her. She wants to become a sommelier. She is the one who helps out the main character since he is a complete amateur when it comes to wine knowledge. She is the first one to realize his talents.Enjoyment: 9/10It is very easy to read and also enjoyable. If you are into rivalry, and competition things,then this story just may be for you! You don't even need to know about wine because this story will tell.Overall: 9/10This sums it up. Everything is great. The flaws that I have to say in here is probably because there isn't something so great to make up attach to the main characters.
The Disinformation Review focuses on key messages carried in the international information space, which have been identified as providing a partial, distorted or false view or interpretation and spreading key pro-Kremlin messaging. It does not necessarily imply, however, that the outlet concerned is linked to the Kremlin or pro-Kremlin, or that it has intentionally sought to disinform. The Review analyses messages, not the messenger. If the message is a) false, which is determined by the facts and b) originating and/or in line with identified pro-Kremlin disinformation messaging, it is included in the product. The Review is a compilation of cases from the East Stratcom Task Force's wide network of contributors and is therefore not considered an official EU position.

This was the treaty which followed the end of the First World War – it caused Germany to undergo significant disarmament, and forbade the country from forming allegiances and invading other territories.

In a groundbreaking article T. L. Freeman discusses the relationship between actual age and effective age. His conclusion is that the passing of the years goes faster as we grow older. This makes sense; for instance when you are 10 years of age , a year represents 10% of your life , and seems like a very long time. However, when you are 50 years old, one year has reduced to only 2% of your life, and hence seems only one-fifth as long.

The international auction house Bonham's says it has sold a small, patchy disc of mold for $14,597. The off-white, nearly 90-year-old swatch of microbes has a rather extraordinary history: it was first created by Alexander Fleming to make penicillin, a revolutionary discovery that brought the world its first antibiotic. Bonham's sold the mold Wednesday, March 1 during an auction in London.

He argues that Republican credibility on foreign policy has been badly damaged by the party's fixation on the "war on terror," the tendency to hype and inflate threats, its refusal to come to grips with complexity in international affairs, and a bad habit of treating foreign policy issues as extensions of domestic political and cultural fights. Here is the core of his thesis:

When I write about the ritual infant circumcision of boys, I try to avoid lazy and crass comparisons to female genital mutilation. FGM, in the form of clitoridectomy (as commonly practised in countries like Somalia), is a horrific procedure that causes unfathomable pain and trauma at the time it is conducted, followed by lifelong sexual pain and dysfunction. There is no question that the physical impacts and health risks of FGM are genuinely incomparable to those of male circumcision, or to give it a less euphemistic description, ritual male genital mutilation.

In the instances where caching is being provided, the SharedCacheMap member of the _SECTION_OBJECT_POINTERS structure is an opaque pointer to the SHARED_CACHE_MAP structure. The SHARED_CACHE_MAP structure is used by the Cache Manager to track the state of cached regions, including the previously described 256-KB VACBs.  The cache manger uses a VACB index arrays to store pointers to the VACBs. As a performance optimizations, the _SHARED_CACHE_MAP contains a VACB index array, InitialVacbs, of 4 pointers, that is used for files 1 MB or less in size. If the file is larger than 1 MB, the Vacbs member of _SHARED_CACHE_MAP is used to store a pointer to a dynamically allocated VACB index array.  If the file is larger than 32 MB, a sparse multilevel index array is created where each index array can hold up to 128 entries. Since we are trying to find all the cached regions that may be memory resident, we recursively walk the sparse multilevel array looking for file data.  The _VACB contains the virtual address of where the data is stored in system cache, BaseAddress,  and the offset where the data is found within the file, FileOffset.  Using this information, we can reconstruct the file based on the cached regions found in memory.

The Intel Core i5-3470 is a relatively fast quad core desktop processor based on the 3rd generation Ivy Bridge architecture which was launched in Q2 2012. It scores a good effective speed of 87 (max turbo frequency of 3.6 Ghz). Unlike the 'K' model processors, the i5-3470 doesn't have an unlocked multiplier, so the max overclocked frequency is not much beyond its stock frequency. The i5-3470 features integrated Intel HD Graphics 2500 which are relatively weak by modern standards, so to enjoy a good 3D gaming experience a GPU upgrade is necessary. Whilst the 3470 is a reasonable CPU, it's only fractionally cheaper than the i5-3570K which scores an effective speed of 98 and has an unlocked multiplier. Overall the 3470 is somewhat dated and there is far better value available in today's market. [Nov '14 CPUPro]

Abstract Powdered milk products for children (Growing Up Milk Powders or GUMPs) containing added carbohydrates such as glucose and sucrose are now well established in parts of Asia. We surveyed GUMPs in Malaysia and Indonesia to determine the content of added carbohydrates. The ingredient lists and nutrition information panels were used to calculate the percentage of declared carbohydrates contributed by added carbohydrates and a subset of seven products was tested for their glycemic index (GI) and insulin responses in healthy adults. The glycemic load for each product was calculated. In total, 58 products (n = 24 in Malaysia and n = 34 in Indonesia) were surveyed. Added carbohydrate content (excluding fibre) ranged from 0 to 21.5 g per serve. Milk powders without added sources of carbohydrate had similar GI values to standard liquid whole milk. Products containing maltodextrins, corn or glucose syrups increased the GI by more than 2-fold, and glycemic load (GL) by 7-fold compared to milk powders with no added carbohydrates. Insulin responses were significantly but not strongly correlated with glucose responses (r = 0.32, p < 0.006). Children's milk powders containing higher levels of added carbohydrate ingredients elicit higher glucose and insulin responses than liquid or powdered whole milk. Keywords: milk, carbohydrate, glycemia, insulinemia, glycemic index

Q . My husband and I recently moved to Millburn NJ. I will be working in NJ while he will work in NYC. We are unsure how NJ and NY state taxes are applied. Does he have to pay state taxes in both states? How does this affect our federal return - do we file jointly or individually? I have heard of "double tax" for people living in NJ and working in NY, but can't seem to determine whether it is the truth or a tax myth. Thanks for any light you can shed on this subject. I hope this fits into the criteria of the type of question you will answer. Thanks, Erin A. A good question, Erin. And one that applies to many NJ taxpayers. First, if you must live in New Jersey at least you have chosen a nice, albeit expensive, place to live. I worked for many years in nearby Summit. One suggestion – go to Route 22 to buy gas for your car. The basic answer is that you will not be "double-taxed". You will receive a credit on the NJ return for the state income tax you pay to NY on your husband's wages. However, as with anything involving taxes, it ain't quite that simple. If you live in one state (New Jersey) and work in another (New York) you must first pay state income tax to the state in which you work (New York) on the wages earned in that state. The non-resident state (New York) will not directly (see below) tax you on your other income (i.e. NJ wages and self-employment earnings, interest, dividends, capital gains, etc.). The state where you live (New Jersey) will tax you on all of your taxable income from all sources, including wages earned in another state (New York). Your resident state (New Jersey) will allow you to claim a credit for any non-resident state income tax paid to another state (New York) on income taxed by both states. Your husband will have New York state income tax withheld from his wages. He will probably not have New Jersey state income tax withheld. He will have to file a New York State Form IT-203 – Nonresident and Part Year Resident Income Tax Return. The way this works is that first you calculate the NY state income tax liability as if you were a full-year NY resident – reporting all income for the year that is taxable to a NY resident and claiming all deductions for the year allowed for a NY resident. You then divide your New York State Adjusted Gross Income from New York State sources (in this case the wages earned from your husband's employment in NY) by your New York State Adjusted Gross Income from all sources (as if you were a full-year resident) – and multiply the result by the NY state income tax liability you had initially calculated as if you were a full-year resident. Sound confusing? Here is an example:

My freelancing to date has largely consisted of ML, stream processing, data integrations, microservices, and other backend work. However, more recently I've shifted to include frontend work with react/reflux/react-native/electron and I have run into a high number of issues with development practices. I find myself declining most work for obvious lapses in development practices and, on occasion, "duped" into accepting a client that sounds good on paper but isn't. I have observed a severe lacking in areas like: - Testing (i.e. usually none, which is often spun like an odd pro that they are so "fast") - Devops (e.g. lack of repeatable/automatic deployments, things must be hand-touched, no continuous integration) - Project management (e.g. no tracking of bugs, features, etc via issues, no milestone usage, no documentation) - Git/Github basics (e.g. don't break the branch when doing PRs, create useful commit messages) - Understanding of CSS/HTML basics (e.g. best practices, standards, anti-patterns) - Understanding of React/Flux basics (e.g. child keys, anti-patterns, bastardizing with some weird approach) - Understanding of functional programming basics (e.g. immutablity, HOFs, pure functions) - Understanding of computer science basics (e.g. weird custom approaches that poorly mimic trees, no big-o concerns that hurt perf, memory leaks) - Separation of concerns (e.g. making UI components know about and concerned with the data persistence layer) - Security (e.g. secure credentials committed, pretty much an afterthought) Are these issues simply the norm for frontend development and something I just need to get used to OR is perhaps my frontend network itself poor and something I just need to work on building up to more "solid" clients? I understand few companies are perfect and I am not asking for it all, but coming across clients with lapses in all these areas is what concerns me.

Hybrid devices are usually a recipe for disappointment. Like the spork, they try to combine the usefulness of two things into one, and, like the spork, they tend to compromise too much. The YotaPhone 2 is a happy exception to that rule. This 5-inch Android smartphone comes with a 4.7-inch e-paper display on its back, which seems like an obvious gimmick until you start using it. I approached the YotaPhone 2 from a position of skepticism, but have been quickly converted: the rear screen can be an effective e-reader, an always-on weather and notification display, a battery-saving gaming screen, and just a really attractive back cover for the phone. I didn't expect to see any exciting new phones until CES in Las Vegas next month, but the YotaPhone has snuck up with perfect pre-Christmas timing and is now one of the most intriguing devices on the market.

WHEN Dmitri Shostakovich answered his phone one day in March 1949 he was told to hold on: Comrade Stalin wanted to speak to him. Stalin expressed surprise that the composer had declined an invitation to go to New York for a cultural conference for peace. Shostakovich said that he was "nauseated". Stalin affected to believe that he was unwell and said he should see a doctor. But the nausea he had experienced was because none of his music and that of his colleagues Sergei Prokofiev and Aram Khatchaturian had been performed in the Soviet Union for more than a year.

The authors state that injection of intramuscular rocuronium "…elicited vigorous movement (e.g., extremity movement against gravity) in 50% of patients…" and attributed this to light anesthesia. One would expect less reaction to pain only from a minor stimulus such as an intramuscular injection during 1 MAC of halothane anesthesia. Recently, however, rocuronium has been reported to cause pain after intravenous injection. [2,3] Fifty-two percent of patients to whom a subparalyzing dose of rocuronium had been administered complained of pain; of these, 12% experienced severe pain. [2] Therefore, some intrinsic irritating property of rocuronium causing pain on injection rather than the "light" anesthesia may be the cause of the reaction described.

Some hold with the theory that the development of an embryo shows the stages of evolution. In other words, what first develops is fishlike, and then like a small mammal, and then like a lemur or ape, and then something we would recognize as human. Very early embryos have what look like little gill slits in the beginning of their development. At about four weeks, embryos have a little tail. At around six to twelve weeks, the white blood cells dissolve the tail, and the fetus develops into an average, tail-less baby... most of the time, at least. Every now and again, we get a little extra bit of baby, in the form of a vestigial tail.

Ahead of their first full series in India since 2009, Sri Lanka have arrived in the country with a bagful of trivia material and scores to settle.

Only two survivors - Angelo Mathews and Rangana Herath - remain from the side that went down 2-0 in the three-Test series in 2009, but it isn't as if members of the current squad are without scars.

RICHMOND, B.C.—British Columbia's premier is heralding a tentative agreement with public school teachers as a historic deal that will grant the province the longest term of education labour peace in 30 years. Christy Clark says if teachers ratify the six-year contract on Thursday, it will be a game-changer in the long-standing dysfunctional relationship and allow children to start their delayed school year as early as Monday. The premier provided few specifics, but says teachers will get a raise, more funding to deal with classroom composition and money to settle outstanding union grievances. Clark says the government will continue its appeal of a court case where a judge has already twice ruled that the removal of the union's right to bargain class size and composition was illegal. A member of the union's bargaining team says the contentious E80 clause, involving class size and composition, was removed from the contract before a settlement was reached.

Guns were an equalizer in the West and required when there was little order and little visible presence of the law given the size of the territories that had to be covered and the lack of officers to handle it. Throw in the fact that in many counties and municipalities lawmen were in the pockets of the rich and powerful who owned land—and lots of it—and you've got some very good reasons why men walked around "well heeled." The Johnson County War (Wyoming) and the Lincoln County War (New Mexico) are just two examples of violence spurred by lawmen that were the arm of a faction that wanted to retain power at any price.

(real name: Christopher Wallace), presented an award to Toni Braxton at the 11th Annual Soul Train Awards in Los Angeles, where several members of the audience booed him. He then headed to the nearby Peterson Automotive Museum for an after-party, which the fire department shut down due to overcrowding. B.I.G. and his entourage left in a three-car motorcade at around 12:30 a.m. Sean (then "Puffy," now " Diddy") Combs, president of Biggie's label Bad Boy Records, was in the first car flanked by three bodyguards. B.I.G. sat in the passenger seat of the second Suburban, joined by two associates and his cousin. Behind Biggie's car was a Chevrolet Blazer, carrying Bad Boy's director of security.

Complementing its neatly tailored looks, the 3 feels as tight as a drum, thanks to its stiff structure. And the firm-yet-compliant suspension teams with a balanced and frisky chassis and Miata-like steering. Our glowing real-world handling judgments weren't dampened much by the car's midpack 0.82-g skidpad performance or so-so 179-foot stopping distance from 70 mph. We tested the 3 at a different venue than usual, and its surface felt noticeably slicker than that on our home turf. Acceleration is fairly zippy, with 60 mph arriving in 7.2 seconds, and the automatic's manual shift mode—operable via the shift lever or steering-wheel paddles—is quick to respond. Sport mode further sharpens the powertrain, and even when left to shift on its own, the transmission always seems to find the right gear. Despite spending most of its time in our hands being hammered down back roads, the 3 returned a respectable 26 mpg—2 mpg shy of its EPA city fuel-economy estimate.

The Red Tear was a Gloriana-class Battleship of the Blood Angels Space Marine Legion that served as the flagship of Primarch Sanguinius during the Great Crusade and the Horus Heresy. The Red Tear was part of the Emperor's grand fleet before the age of the Great Crusade began around 800.M30. When the Emperor reunited with his long-lost son Sanguinius on the world of Baal, he gifted The Angel with the magnificent vessel to lead his IX Legion into the stars. Within and without, the Red Tear was a shipwright's work of art. The vessel carried the flag of the Blood Angels whenever the Primarch left the Legion homeworld of Baal, and like Sanguinius himself, his flagship was a beautiful sight to behold.
MUZAFFARPUR: There is many a slip between a cup and the lip. This proverb holds true of Shahi litchi crop in Muzaffarpur district this year. The crop, which was developing in a normal way till a month back due to favourable weather conditions, has been damaged upto 40% in general due to abnormal rise in temperature, hot westerly wind, total absence of rain and sharp fall in humidity just 20 days prior to its harvesting.Fruit harvesting has been delayed by a week and if the growers wait for another three to five days more, it might assume the normal reddish colour and its pulp may gain more weight because of the easterly wind which has started blowing since Saturday morning. This is for the first time in the last 15 years that no rainfall has been recorded in the district in May so far.While moving in Jhapaha orchard of Bholanath Jha on Saturday morning, the principal scientist of National Litchi Research Centre, Muzaffarpur, S K Purve said 40% of crop has been burnt by heat wave in Bochaha-Mushahari belt as the absentee orchard owners could not adopt proper safety measures to save their crops from excessive heat. On the other hand, he was satisfied to see bunches of normal sized litchi resting on the ground. This, he said, was only because of the constant care taken by Jha to save the fruit. He said in such orchards, one quintal of litchi is possible from each tree. Adopting scientific methods for the growth of the crop never goes unrewarded, Purve remarked.Litchi grower Jha, who had received the award of 'Udyan Ratna' from the state government a few years back, said farmers have to grow high-rise creepers around the orchard or cover it with other dense leafy trees particularly on the western side to protect this hot-weather fruit from excessive heat. Efforts to keep the orchard cool as far as possible helps the fruit in getting normal size, sweetness, aroma and colour.Jha said the abnormal rise in temperature has affected the size of the fruit this year, in general. Weight of each piece is only 14 to 15 grams whereas it should have been 20 to 25 gm. Litchi has the capacity to tolerate the temperature up to 38 degree but has crossed 40 degree in the last 15 days. The minimum humidity the fruit can sustain is 50, but it fell down to 17 to 20% during the pre-harvest period. That is why the traders of Mumbai have rejected the first consignment of litchi and have asked the growers to wait for five days more.Plucking of litchi has started in most of the orchards. It is being sold at Rs 100 per 100 piece in the local market whereas it was only Rs 60 last year. 'China' variety is expected to give good return to the growers and traders but it does not have the aroma of Shahi variety. 'China' variety's harvesting is expected after a week. The litchi season will come to an end by June 15.The NLRC is trying to extend this season up to July end but it might take another five years. Experiments with breeds from China and Thailand are going on for the last couple of years, NLRC scientists informed.

Review: Southown's brand-new Burger Culture a welcome blast from the past
The biotech industry has quietly inserted a dangerous policy rider into the Agriculture Appropriations bill now being considered in Congress. Though wrapped in a "farmer-friendly" package, this "farmer assurance provision" is simply a biotech industry ploy to continue to plant GE crops even when a court of law has found they were approved illegally. The provision undermines USDA's oversight of GE crops, interferes with the U.S. judicial review process, and could be unconstitutional. It is also completely unnecessary and serves only to offer "assurance" to biotech companies like Monsanto, not farmers.

That's exactly what Magic Body Control intends to do. A camera situated at the top of the windshield scans the road ahead, analyzing its flaws and blemishes, and feeds that data directly to the ABC system's control unit. The camera scans the area 15 to 45 feet in front of the car, and it can detect and measure imperfections as small as 0.4 to 0.8 inch. In doing so, the system knows exactly what the tires will encounter just fractions of a second into the future. The series-production use of a camera to gather road data is different from the laser-based approach used on the F700 concept, where the technology was called PRE-SCAN. The camera also feeds information to the Distronic cruise control. "We are putting a lot of effort into sensor fusion," says Balasubramanian. "It's a matter of programming the right algorithms."

Although nerve growth factor plays a role in augmenting sodium channel expression in small dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells, the cytochemical mediators responsible for enhanced expression in large DRG neurons are unknown. To narrow the search for mediators involved in the increased production of sodium channels in large DRG neurons, we examined the effect of cyclooxygenase inhibition on sodium channel production during inflammation. Thirty minutes before the subcutaneous injection of complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA), rats received ibuprofen (nonselective, cyclooxygenase inhibitor), NS-398 (selective, cyclooxygenase inhibitor), or vehicle. Withdrawal thresholds from thermal and mechanical stimulation were measured before and immediately after CFA injection and at selected hourly intervals after injection for the next 24 hours. Sodium channel up-regulation was then examined in DRG by using site-specific, anti–sodium channel antibodies, Na v 1.7 and 1.8. Both ibuprofen and NS-398 provided analgesia during the second phase of inflammatory hyperalgesia that begins 3 hours after CFA injection. The up-regulation, predominantly of Na v 1.7 and minimally of Na v 1.8 channels, seen in vehicle-treated rats was suppressed by both drugs at 24 hours after injection. By 72 hours after injection, no difference in labeling between the drug- and vehicle-treated animals was observed. Sodium channel labeling in large DRG neurons returned to baseline between 1 and 2 weeks after CFA injection, whereas small cell labeling persisted. The cytochemical signal for sodium channel up-regulation in the large DRG cells that most closely correlates with inflammatory hyperalgesia is mediated at least in part through products of the cyclooxygenase pathway.

We headed off to the Guinea-Bissau consulate getting there about 9:30AM. There were already a few people there waiting on visas including a pastor from Dallas who had come overland from Dakar. The visa was super easy, required a passport photo or passport photocopy + 20k CFA ($33.35). As we were waiting, a tour group of 60-year old American women pulls up. Guinea-Bissau seemed like an odd destination for that demographic! We had our visas in hand by 10AM.We went in search of an ATM, the one I'd used yesterday didn't work. It started drizzling as we walked around. Finally found one that worked, right next to the hotel. There was a line of people waiting and they said usually this is the ATM that didn't work!Got to GB consulate abt 9:30, pastor from Dallas, had come overland from Dakar. Very easy process, just a passport photo or photocopy of passport and 20k CFA ($33.50). Got there just in time as a tourbus full of older American and German ladies arrived to get their visas. Seems an odd demographic going to Guinea-Bissau. We had our visas in hand by 10AM.I had already spent most of my CFA so wandered around town to find a working ATM, and it started drizzling rain. Today the streets were much busier than yesterday (Sunday). Finally found a working ATM right next to the hotel, one of the guys waiting in line said this was the ATM that usually didn't work!Caught a taxi (500 CFA) to the gare routiere where ironmanjt helped negotiate a Guinea-Bissau share taxi all the way to Bissau. 38000 CFA ($63.75) for the whole taxi and we were off. This sept-place had a fabulous purple shag seats. We set off about 11:30AM. The border was only about 15kms away and we were processed through quickly. Another change of language, this time from French to Portuguese.Shag Purple Taxi, Ziguinchor-BissauThe road in Guinea-Bissau was in decent condition most of the way. Local kids were selling peeled oranges alongside the road. Definitely a poorer country than Senegal. The main official economy is peanuts and cashews. The unofficial economy is drug transit between South America and Europe.DanielW buying orangesWe arrived in Bissau about 2:30 and went to the taxi park before asking the driver to take us all the way to the hotel. He didn't know where it was so had to get a local guy to come along with us. At first they took us to the Coimbra Bar, not Coimbra hotel. I used my GPS to direct him the right way. Bissau was the dustiest capital I had seen so far. Even the main street was just bright red dust.The Coimbra hotel was the most expensive so far, $120/nt. Air con was good and wifi worked occasionally. The rain had stopped so DanielW and I decided to go out exploring a bit. The Catholic church was next door to the hotel. One thing I've noticed traveling in countries, in English-speaking countries churches seem to always be open. In Portuguese countries, churches are locked. Not sure of the reason, but all the churches we visited in Angola and Sao Tome were closed as well. The town definitely had a run-down feel. We wandered down to the port area before going into Bissau Velho (Old Bissau), a few square blocks of colorful colonial buildings.As we were wandering, some guys came up to us and asked if we wanted a boat out to the Bijagos islands. The Bijagos archipelago is one of the tourist draws, there is a ferry that is supposed to run on Fridays, returning on Sunday. Otherwise the option is by expensive (and not-so-safe) speedboats or piroges. Then asked where we were from. I said Kazakhstan (my go-to country) and the guy starts speaking to me in Russian! Go figure, he'd spent 8 years in Russia. They kept following us but finally we shook them off.Bissau, Guinea-BissauWandered past the fort (still in use by the military, so no photos!) and up to a church. We noticed a good-looking restaurant we planned to come back to for dinner. The O-Bistro seemed to be the place to go for expats. It was already pretty busy when we arrived and as we were eating about 5 SUVs pulled up, full of Chinese workers. Good food too. I had tagliatele with shrimp and caramel crepes for dessert, but I think ironman's profiterole looked better.O BistroHotel Coimbra

Numerous studies have shown functional links between the cannabinoid and opioid systems. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether acute treatments by endogenous cannabinoid agonist, selective CB1 or CB2 receptor antagonists modulate the expression of mu- (MOR) and delta- (DOR) opioid receptor mRNA levels and functional activity in the cerebellum of transgenic mice deficient in the CB1 type of cannabis receptors. We examined the effect of noladin ether (endogenous cannabinoid agonist) pretreatment on MOR and DOR mRNA expression by using reverse transcription and real-time polimerase chain reaction (PCR) and the ability of subsequent application of the opioid agonists to activate G-proteins, as measured by [35S]GTPgammaS binding, in wild-type (CB1+/+) and CB1 cannabinoid receptor deficient (CB1-/-, 'knockout', K.O.) mice. The acute administration of noladin ether markedly reduced MOR-mediated G-protein activation and caused a significant increase in the level of MOR mRNAs in the cerebella of wildtype, but not in the CB1-/- mice. No significant differences were observed in DOR functional activity and mRNA expression in wild-type animals. In CB1-/- mice the expression of DOR mRNA increased after noladin ether treatment, but no changes were found in DOR functional activity. In addition, Rimonabant (selective central cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist) and SR144528 (selective peripheral cannabinoid CB2 receptor antagonist) caused significant potentiation in MOR functional activity in the wild-type animals, whereas DOR mediated G-protein activation was increased in the CB1-/- mice. In contrast, Rimonabant and SR144528 decreased the MOR and DOR mRNA expressions in both CB1+/+ and CB1-/- mice. Taken together, these results indicate that acute treatment with cannabinoids causes alterations in MOR and DOR mRNA expression and functional activity in the cerebella of wild-type and CB1 knockout mice indicating indirect interactions between these two signaling systems.

Biological invasions are not only events with substantial environmental and socioeconomic impacts but are also interesting natural experiments, allowing the study of phenomena such as the cultural evolution of bird song following introduction. We took an excellent opportunity to compare the distribution of dialects of the yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella, a small Eurasian passerine, in its native source region (Great Britain) and invaded range (New Zealand) more than hundred years after relocation. Recent field recordings (including those provided by volunteers within a citizen science project) were complemented by those from archives, each assigned to appropriate dialect by visual inspection of a sonogram, and the resulting spatial patterns of dialect distribution were interpreted using historical data on the yellowhammer invasion. The two countries differ markedly in the composition and distribution of dialects. New Zealand populations sing a greater number of different dialects, seven in total, five of which were not detected in the current British population, but have been reported by previous studies from the continental Europe. Two identified localities of capture (Brighton, Sussex, UK) and release (Dunedin, Otago, NZ) differ even more strikingly, having no dialects in common. The largely sedentary nature of yellowhammers allows for two mutually exclusive explanations for European dialects being detected in New Zealand but not in Great Britain: 1) the corresponding song types have emerged de novo in New Zealand, through convergent cultural evolution; 2) the dialects have disappeared from Great Britain, while being preserved in New Zealand. Indirect evidence from the widespread occurrence of these dialects in continental Europe and the reported stability of yellowhammer song, supports the latter explanation. We suggest that the yellowhammer dialect system is an avian equivalent of a phenomenon already noted in human languages, in which ancient words or structures are retained in expatriate communities.

In 1976, a young woman in Krakow is making her diploma film, looking behind the scenes at the life of a 1950s bricklayer, Birkut, who was briefly a proletariat hero, at how that heroism was created, and what became of him. She gets hold of outtakes and censored footage and interviews the man's friends, ex-wife, and the filmmaker who made him a hero. A portrait of Birkut emerges: he believed in the workers' revolution, in building housing for all, and his very virtues were his undoing. Her hard-driving style and the content of the film unnerve her supervisor, who kills the project with the excuse she's over budget. Is there any way she can push the film to completion?

The main goal of this article is to the present research on the development of ketamine derivatives. The target molecule was a fluoroderivative of ketamine, for which a multistep synthesis has been reported. This novel ketamine derivative, 2-(2-fluorophenyl)-2-methylamino-cyclohexanone, has been called fluoroketamine by our research group. The starting fluorobenzonitrile was reacted with the appropriate Grignard reagent followed by the bromination reaction to obtain α-bromocyclopentyl-(2-fluorophenyl)-ketone. The reaction of the obtained ketone with methylamine at −40 °C then resulted in the formation of α-hydroxycyclopentyl-(2-flourophenyl)-N-methylamine. Finally, the five-memberd ring cyclopentanol was expanded to the cyclohexylketone by a thermal rearrangement reaction. The HCl salt of the target molecule, which is soluble in water, was obtained by the acidification of the free fluoroketamine with HCl. Preliminary animal tests on mice have shown that the resulting fluoroketamine has some advantages over ketamine in terms of the effective dose and the recovery time.

The term 'alternative' or 'complementary' diet refers to any modification to a normal diet that claims to cure or treat cancer. These diets may be advocated for use in conjuction with, or instead of, conventional anti‐cancer treatment. Although treated with scepticism by the dietetic and medical professions, they are popular with patients. Most of the dietary therapies share the same common philosphy and strict dietary principles. In general, these diets appears to be more harmful than beneficial, in nutritional terms at least, Some cancer patients do seem to drive some benefit from these therapies. This article proposes the theory that this benefit is psychological rather than nutritional, a placebo effect. The psychological theories of expectancy effects, cognitive dissonance, anxiety reduction and the therapist effect are explored in order to support this theory. The author proposes that sound nutritional advice, given with attention to the psychological theories stated, could achieve the same if not greater benefit, and proposes further research in this field.

Ecuador's President Correa was well-rewarded for his trip last week to China, but this could have grave impacts for the Amazon and the people who live there. On Wednesday, Beijing agreed to lend Ecuador $7.53 billion to help the heavily oil-dependent economy cope with the recent drop in global crude prices. This latest sum – the largest China has ever lent Ecuador – brings Chinese financing to Ecuador to nearly $25 billion, over a quarter of the nation's GDP. In 2013 Beijing provided 61% of Ecuador's external financing and purchased 83% of Ecuador's oil; this latest loan will undoubtedly bring both numbers much higher.

The news comes on the heels of Twitter's latest quarterly report, which not only revealed that it would be laying off 350 employee, but that it was also restructuring to be profitable in 2017. And no wonder -- though it continues to make money, Twitter has never turned a profit and user growth has remained stagnant. Even after co-founder Jack Dorsey took over as CEO last year, the company just couldn't seem to turn its fortunes around.

It's no secret that Katy Perry and Taylor Swift aren't part of each other's squad. The two used to be close friends (even after that time they both dated John Mayer), but after that 2013 Rolling Stone article seen around the world, things went south. Here's a quick refresher from the article:
To become a good engineer of business major, a student must first study the all-important subjects of race and ethnicity — at least according to student government leaders at the University of Michigan, who are working to extend the liberal arts college's race requirements to all colleges of the university.

Because it was housed in a protective plastic case, which was allergic to my flash, my photo cannot possibly do full justice to the US pre-debut of the gorgeous Rubicon Atomic AD/DA preamp (price not yet announced, probably under $40,000, hopefully to be demonstrated in full form at the Rocky Mountain AudioFest in October and available for purchase at the end of the year). This 384kHz converter, phono preamp, and headphone amplifier with an integrated atomic clock and gold-plated relay volume control utilizes the 10M Rubidium atomic clock, which is said to be 100,000 times more stable than a traditional crystal oscillator. Coupled with Antelope's 64-bit "Acoustically Focused Clocking technology" the Rubidium purportedly manages jitter superbly. Already boasting an award from Japan, the unit is one of several from the company that uses DACs endorsed by Morten Lindberg, founder and chief engineer of audiophile label 2L.

In every respect but one, Iowa's Republican caucuses delivered a conventional result on Tuesday. In 2008, Iowan churchgoers laid hands on an affable rock guitarist, Mike Huckabee. This time, they have lifted up the much less likable Rick Santorum. In any event, the corporate-funded wing of the Party will now muster its financing, polling, and ad-making machine to assure the nomination of its candidate, Mitt Romney. It would be very surprising if it failed.

This week's post concerns vehicle towing, which hopefully will be more interesting that you might imagine. The data comes from Open Baltimore and consists of approximately 62,000 vehicles towed over the last five years (October 23rd, 2010 to November 12th, 2015). Unfortunately, for each towing, a street address, rather than a latitudinal and longitudinal coordinate, is recorded. However, thanks to the power of Google (and a few bucks from yours truly), it is possible to convert almost all of these addresses (98.3%) into latitudinal and longitudinal coordinates, which can then be visualized. Doing so gives a broad overview of towing in the city:
St Aloysius, who cared for the sick during the Great Plague (1315-1317 I believe) was so kind to fleas that is was said that though his cassock (robe) was swarming with all sorts of vermin, he'd not take the life of a flea! He paid the price... he died of the plague not knowing that fleas were the carrier.
Instead, the White House wanted to divert funds to the promising ITER tokamak fusion reactor. Though located in France, US researchers would have a direct line to the massive project, which aims to help transition fusion from the experimental phase to a practical reactor. Once MIT found out that its own reactor would be cut, however, it mobilized its lobbying arm, and convinced local congressman Michael Capuano that it was worth saving. He recruited a group including Senator Elizabeth Warren, which pitched other other representatives on the merits of the project. They emphasized the patriotic angle by showing a map with hundreds of subcontractors in 47 of 50 states which supplied the project.
A few days ago, Bill Simmons and Kevin Durant met for their fourth Bill Simmons Podcast interview. Part 1 dropped on the heels of the Kyrie Irving–to–Boston trade, and Durant weighed in on Irving's trade request from a player's perspective. But after one of the busiest and most surprising NBA offseasons in recent memory, Simmons and Durant had much more to discuss. In the Part 2 of the podcast, they assessed the other huge trades: Jimmy Butler to Minnesota, Paul George to Oklahoma City, and Chris Paul to Houston. Durant assesses the fit of each player on his new team. Read a portion of their conversation below, and listen to the full episode to hear Durant answer more mailbag questions.

Scattering ashes at sea in recent years has become very mainstream; thousands chose burial at sea for their loved ones. This has evolved in part because the rate of cremation has doubled in the United States in the past 15 years. In 2014, nearly one in two Americans (46.7 percent) selected cremation as an alternative to burial. This compares to only about one in four people (24.8 percent) who chose cremation in 1999. These findings come from the Cremation Statistics Annual Report produced by CANA, the preeminent source on cremation data for the United States and Canada.
Jonathan Bernstein makes a catch he plausibly calls the best self-refuting argument ever. See, Diane Black, one of the House Republicans sponsoring a resolution complaining about President Obama's recent recess appointments, issued a press release with the following two lines:

We have our first juicy feud of the London Olympics, and they involve two American athletes! Current US Soccer star Hope Solo and former US Soccer star Brandi Chastain just plain don't like each other. As far as the origins of the feud go, I'm not so sure, but it boiled over this afternoon on Twitter when the American GK fired a couple cannon shots at the hero of the 1999 World Cup and current NBC analyst. Solo called out Chastain for recent comments from her analyst's chair. It's appropriate that Solo's Twitter avatar is her getting ready to throw hands, because these are some haymakers…

Multiple members of the Camaro6 forum uploaded pics of their sixth-gen Chevrolet Camaro spottings and there is no beating around the bush about it: the new kid on the block looks better out in the wild compared to the press and launch photos from the premiere.The most interesting pic in the adjacent gallery is the one portraying 6 examples of the breed. From left to right, the first half of thegang includes a Silver Ice Metallic RS model with a black stripe on the hood, followed by two more RS models wearing Mosaic Black Metallic and Nightfall Gray Metallic. The surplus of cars consists of a Garnet Red Tintcoat Camaro SS, what appears to be a gloss Black Camaro SS and a Silver Ice Metallic Camaro RS sans the stripe.If anything, the 20-inch black-painted aluminum 5-spoke wheels look better than the silver or gray-painted alloys. There's another photograph portraying two RS units and an SS sandwiched between a 2015 Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 and a 2016 Cadillac ATS-V, the platform brother of the #CamaroSix.Looking atand sixth-gen side by side is somewhat strange at first glance. The exterior differences between the two generations are subtle, yet there's no hiding the fact the 2016 Camaro is a wee bit smaller than its honorable predecessor in ZL1 format.Then comes a set of pics of a Bright Yellow SS. Don't know about you, but the contrast between the paint job and the black exterior trim, joined by the red-and-black seats are to die for. Bumblebee approves.Be it an RS or SS, what color would your 2016 Camaro be?

I don't necessarily have an idea of what the skin would look like, but I would personally like to point out Orianna is a champion that has such a lore that it would almost be wrong to not give her such a skin. Having her in her old, ballerina, or more so just human self would simply be great. I'm not an artist, so I can't necessarily design it. But as a player, I would buy a skin like this a million times over. My ideas for this skin: Have a ball built kinda toyish by her father, and have her with a joystick to control it. Humanized Redone voice to match a human girl Teens, I'm guessing, so more petite than and older and more developed Just, please... Her lore almost demands it, and Kassadin has a "Pre-Void" skin, so I just figured, maybe... ~V7 Bliss, Silver V, Lore Lover and Orianna Fanboy {{champion:61}}

Regardless of their immigration status, noncitizens who have been convicted of an "aggravated felony" are prohibited from receiving most forms of relief that would spare them from deportation, including asylum, and from being readmitted to the United States at any time in the future.

In one of the first major announcements to come out of this year's San Diego Comic-Con , Dynamite Entertainment has confirmed Masks , a new mini-series that not only sees the first team-up of classic pulp heroes like the Shadow, the Spider and the Green Hornet , but also sees Alex Ross' first full interior work on a comic in years . The book is written by Chris Roberson ( MonkeyBrain Comics , iZombie ).Although he's contributed pages to other Dynamite projects like Project Superpowers and Kirby: Genesis in recent years, Ross -- who made his name with the photo-realistic work on classic projects like Marvels and Kingdom Come in the 1990s -- hasn't handled the art chores for an entire comic since 2009's Justice Society of America Kingdom Come Special: Superman , and even then, he wasn't providing fully-painted art as he does in the first issue of Masks. In fact, his last solo painted project was JLA: Liberty and Justice , way back in 2003. What brought him back, he explained in a statement, is the chance to be part of history:
Feel like i'm on a NASA flow. Space talk. Mars is one of the most talked about planets because their is suspicion but limited evidence that their has been human life living there. WRONG. Why do they assume it must be human life, it could be any other life, just think about it for a second... ya. We already have the thought that it must be human life. Therefore, we are bias to the fact that it could be any other life form. What about Aliens? Speaking of Aliens, if they live in space be very afraid. On Earth we've accumulated so much garbage that we have decided to poop it all out in space. Just like we like our environment clean i'm sure they like there's the same way. The world will end because Humans are inconsiderate. Fear the wrath of Aliens. Houston we have a problem... jimmy

Even under the best of circumstances, writing is a difficult task. It requires a great deal of concentration, as well as plenty of time for daydreaming, experimenting, and chasing potential dead ends. So when the British novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature today, found himself stalled on a book, he and his wife developed a plan. He would set aside four weeks to devote himself exclusively to writing. And his wife, Lorna? She would take care of everything else.

This has become the new cliché for yuppie types or any pseudo-intellectual types or just idiots that think it sounds special. It is simply just another way of saying: contact, call, speak to, notify, etc. It really sounds faggy and flags the speaker as being self conscious about how they sound to their peers. You also have to wonder who they think they're impressing when they speak like they have an Emily Post book on etiquette shoved up their ass.

There is an image from the yesterday's nightmare in Boston which I cannot get out of my mind, probably because it's at once both horrific and holy. As first responders ran towards the victims of the bombing, the "cruel irony," as reporter Charles Pierce put it, was that "the barricades meant to protect the spectators briefly prevented the EMTs from reaching the injured." I see the footage, and I can almost sense their desperation, knowing that people need help, and that mere seconds can be the difference between life and death. And yet I'm filled with awe. Just who are these people, doing the holiest thing a human being can do: running towards the injured and dead instead of running away from them.

Today, whisk(e)y writer Jim Murray, the most well-known name in the judging of brown spirits, announced the winning whiskies among those judged for his annual release of the Whiskey Bible (available November 24), his guide to every whiskey (over 1,000 of them) that he graded over the course of 2015. The guide is always controversial: last year Murray gave the top award to Yamazaki Sherry Cask 2013, marking the first time that a Japanese whisky took the title; he didn't include a single bottle from Scotland on the shortlist. This year, however, marks the high-water mark for Murray's controversy. The 2016 World Whisky of the Year is an offering from Crown Royal, a company that was second in US whiskey sales only to Jack Daniels in 2014. The distillery's new release, Northern Harvest Rye, scored 97.5 points on Murray's 100-point scale to take home the title. The runner-up is another rye; third place goes to an Irish whiskey, a first for the island nation; and again, no Scottish bottles made the top five.

Deploying blueprints in vRealize Automation is one thing, but with all things as code, we need to be able to move this work from our test instances to development and production instances. It's pretty important to be sure that the code being moved to a new instance is identical. We don't want to have a user re-create the blueprints or workflows because it's prone to user error. Luckily for us, we have a solution. VMware has the vRealize Code Stream Management Pack for IT DevOps which I though about nicknaming vRCSMPITDO but that didn't really roll off the tongue. VMware previously nicknamed this product "Houdini" so for the purposes of this post, we'll use that too! This article will kick off a few more posts on using the product but for now we'll focus on installing it.

Last May, the U.S. Supreme Court issued what was perhaps the most significant death penalty ruling in a decade when it rejected Florida's standard for putting to death defendants who may be intellectually disabled. The U.S. Supreme Court has said that capital punishment for the intellectually disabled is unconstitutional. But Florida was one of several states that was arguably doing it anyway, by making the standard for proving disability so onerous that almost no one could meet it.

Anders (Sweden) had hiked to the top of Mt. Pu with some friends on the morning of December 26, 2004 and was there to witness the waves coming ashore. He had his digital camera with him and took these awesome (and sobering) pictures of the tsunami hitting North Beach in Koh Pu. The first picture is Anders and his family celebrating Christmas on the porch of their hut at Andaman Beach Resort. The group shot half-way down the page is a before-tsunami dinner at Koh Jum Seafood with friends. Him and his wife Helen were staying at Andaman Beach Resort when the tsunami hit and the pictures on the second half of the page are of the damage to the bungalows. They were in the yellow/purple one and lost everything, including his laptop with a couple thousand digital pictures they had taken of their trip to Thailand. That hurts. Below that is a great shot of all the coral that got rinsed up onto shore by the waves. The beach has since been cleaned up, but you can see the mess the waves left behind. Cheers, Anders. Thank you very much for the great pictures. Click thumbnail for larger All pictures ©Anders Grawin

The M60E3 7.62mm machine gun is a lightweight, air-cooled, disintegrating metallic link-belt fed, portable or tripod mounted machine gun designed for ground operations like its predecessor, the M60. It is gas operated with fixed headspace and timing which permits rapid changing of barrels. (Associated components: mount, tripod, machine gun, 7.62mm, M122). Slightly different from its "parent," the M60, the M60E3 has a receiver-attached bipod which easily deploys for stability. It has an ambidextrous safety, universal sling attachments, a carrying handle on the barrel, and a simplified gas system that does not require safety wire to prevent loosening. However, the light weight barrel is not safe for overhead fire and is not capable of sustaining a rapid rate of fire of 200 rounds per minute without catastrophic failure of the barrel.

Because otherwise, it could only be read as the self-pitying rant of someone who has lost a historically defining argument – someone who has been "sonned," to use Coates' term -- and is still too hurt to have access to his powers of reason.
When, on 10 February 2014, we crossed the frontier between Serbia and Bosnia aboard a tiny Eurolines bus, one of our fellow passengers, a young man in his late teens, was asked to step down from the bus and disappeared into the police station. The officers had suspicions he was part of the crowd that had gathered in front of the Mostar Canton government building on 7 February as it went up in flames and wanted to know more about it. After a 30-minute interrogation, they finally let him go. As he stepped back into the bus and it was clear he had definitely made it across the border, his joy erupted. Of course he was there! Like in Tuzla, like in Sarajevo, people attacked and burned down the government building, and it was a wonderful sight! Even better, in the divided city of Mostar, he saw people from both sides, Bosniaks and Croats, hugging each other in front of the burning building! He was hoping to be back in time for the plenum; he was constantly receiving text messages from his friends who were now in the streets in Mostar, and he could not wait to be there.

Despite widespread use of antibiotics in children, the effects of antibiotic exposure on the developing infant gut microbiome have remained underexplored. Here, Yassour et al. present a longitudinal study capturing how the gut microbiome responds to and recovers from antibiotic perturbations. Antibiotic-treated children had less stable and less diverse bacterial communities. Antibiotic resistance genes within the guts of these children peaked after antibiotic treatment but generally returned rapidly to baseline. Delivery mode (vaginal versus cesarean) also had strong long-term effects on microbial diversity. These data give insights into the consequences of early life factors such as birth mode and antibiotic treatment on the infant gut microbiome.

It starts off telling the story about a girl Penelope who loved this boy Odysseus. To her his was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen. Like most amazing love story their love was somewhat forbidden. So that's why when they were finally able to be together I felt like everything was right in the world. I

"When my 13 year-old daughter asked why a lawyer needs another lawyer, I explained that this case and our swift uncompromising victory provided the answer: I could not have done for myself what Lisa and her team did. To win against the Trump Federal Government required deep understanding, masterful strategizing and a tenacious resolve. Lisa stood by me, reflecting my sentiment in a way that made me feel as if we were of one mind. She is so easy to get along with, available at all times and made things seem effortless as she softened the challenging steep terrain with her brilliance and confident expertise. With Lisa's help in attaining this victory, I now feel even more empowered to assert my First Amendment rights which the Government failed to negate, and will continue to speak out for the political, LGBTQI and human rights issues that are important to me. I will never forget Lisa's kindness and the extraordinary service of her adept team. Thank you Lisa and The Bloom Firm."

A Film About Coffee is a love letter to, and meditation on, specialty coffee. It examines what it takes, and what it means, for coffee to be defined as "specialty." The film whisks audiences on a trip around the world, from farms in Honduras and Rwanda to coffee shops in Tokyo, Portland, Seattle, San Francisco and New York. Through the eyes and experiences of farmers and baristas, the film offers a unique overview of all the elements—the processes, preferences and preparations; traditions old and new—that come together to create the best cups. This is a film that bridges gaps both intellectual and geographical, evoking flavor and pleasure, and providing both as well.

To investigate the relationship between community-level socioeconomic factors and the incidence of gang-related homicide in the city of Los Angeles. An ecological group-level analysis was conducted to correlate the 5-year incidence rates (from 1988 through 1992) of gang-related homicide with community-level socioeconomic statistics for the 18 geographically distinct Los Angeles Police Department divisions. Eight socioeconomic factors were examined: (1) log mean per capita income, (2) proportion employed, (3) proportion high school graduates, (4) proportion single-parent families, (5) proportion male, (6) proportion younger than 20 years of age, (7) proportion African American, and (8) proportion Hispanic. Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for the interrelationships among the study variables and gang-related homicide. Adjusted regression estimates were calculated from a multiple linear regression model. The overall 5-year gang-related homicide rate for the city was 48.8 per 100,000, with a range of 5.2 to 173.5 per 100,000 among the different Los Angeles Police Department divisions. Pearson correlation coefficients revealed that the strongest negative correlations with gang-related homicide were log mean per capita income and proportion employed, and the strongest positive correlations were proportion single-parent families and proportion younger than 20 years of age. With mutual adjustment of all variables, only log mean per capita income and proportion employed were significantly associated with gang-related homicide. At the community level, gang-related homicide in Los Angeles is most closely associated with lower income and unemployment. These relationships may provide important insights into the causes of gang formation and gang violence.

Apparently Comey doesn't want to be spied on. In questions during a conference at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Comey revealed that cam-covering is commonplace at the FBI and other government offices. "It's not crazy that the FBI director cares about personal security as well," he added. "If you go into any government office, we all have our little camera things that sit on top of the screen, they all have a little lid that closes down on them. You do that so people who do not have authority don't look at you. I think that's a good thing."

We reserved one of the three campsites at Sevenmile Hole in the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone back in April. Like the previous weekend, Mike, Katy, and I had been thinking about this one for a while. With an early start from Jackson and a brief stop in Canyon for our backcountry permit, we were on the trail at about 9:30. Two hours later, after hiking along the rim of the canyon and passing through an active geothermal area as we descended to the river, we were setting up camp and fishing shortly thereafter.

The first "gerrymander" was drawn on a map and signed into law on February 11, 1812. Elbridge Gerry, then governor of Massachusetts, signed into law a redistricting plan designed to keep his political party in power in the upcoming election. Upset that the Federalist Party was critical of James Madison's foreign policy, Gerry signed the reapportioning plan that heavily favored his Republican party. Gerry, a man who staunchly followed his principles even against the popular actions of his colleagues, was hesitant to sign the law. The Republican legislators sponsoring and forcing through the bill redrew "voting lines so that the Federalist vote was concentrated in a few districts, while the Republican vote was spread over many. " The redistricting authorized by Gerry won 29 seats for the his Republican party, whereas the Federalists won a puny 11 seats.* Gerry's district of Essex was a particularly odd shape, long on one side and curved along the north end.
Seth Rogen will forever be a thorn in Amy Pascal's side.

It's not that cleaning people weren't hired; it's just that for some reason, they just keep on taking breaks to eat all the chips.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) is one of the first agencies established by the United Nations to administer refugees, preceding even the creation of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).

Today, UNRWA promises to deliver services as a "neutral human development agency," according to Chris Gunness, a spokesperson at UNRWA.

That was true, and essential for American security, until this week. With his barrage of executive orders, Trump is taking America back to the historical nightmares of the world before December 1941: closed borders, limited trade, intolerance to diversity, arms races, and a go-it-alone national race to the bottom. His executive order on "rebuilding the U.S. armed forces" calls for "peace through strength," but this document and the others he signed offer nothing but unilateralism and militarization: more military spending, more nuclear weapons, more use of torture (which is illegal), and more promises to destroy ISIS and other terrorist threats. The executive orders promise to curtail American participation in international organizations, prohibit whole categories of foreigners from entering our country, and limit exchanges of ideas and goods. This is not a United States any president from Roosevelt to Reagan would recognize.

Occasionally, we come across interesting scenarios that require thinking outside the box. For example: What if you've obtained a target user's credentials (via responder.py, brute-forcing, sniffing, keylogging, etc.), but don't have access to their workstation? This raises the question of whether a domain username and password could be useful without a workstation to authenticate against. Most organizations use Exchange for email, and make it externally accessible (via OWA or RPC over HTTPS). The AutoDiscover DNS record simplifies most of this process requiring a user to simply input his or her domain credentials into Outlook to setup the remote connection. Hopefully you can see where we're going with this. If not, read on!

This turns out to be, at best, a grim half-truth, although it's hard to imagine anything matching the emotional sucker-punch of the film's gasp-inducing opening sideswipe. Yet even as shocking bereavement gives way to more generic dismemberment, director Neil Marshall's nihilistic frightener keeps us believing that things can only get worse. Thus we plunge down the dark, dank pothole of one of the best British horror films of recent years.

If you were a child growing up in China in the late nineteen-eighties, you learned fairly early the universe of things that were less than dependable: hot water, the bus schedule, and, most irritatingly—if you were an introverted second grader—the capricious offerings of the itinerant book cart. But one aspect of our lives, from birth until, it seemed to me, death, remained as constant as the sunrise. This was the voice of the loudspeaker broadcasts in our Army hospital compound (my mother was a military doctor), which woke me every morning before I could witness the dawn, accompanying me through all three meals and, as I brushed my teeth for bed, sometimes long after dusk.

1. Berry: Entire pericarp is fleshy, although skin is sometimes tough; may be one or many seeded. E.g. grape, tomato, papaya, pomegranate, sapote, persimmon, guava, banana and avocado. The latter two fruits are often termed baccate (berry-like). The banana fruit is a seedless, parthenocarpic berry developing without pollination and fertilization. In the pomegranate, the edible part is the fleshy layer (aril) around each seed. For photos of many of these berries, look them up by their common name in the Wayne's Word Index. According to Spjut (1994), the pepo is not limited to the gourd family (Cucurbitaceae). The papaya (Carica) is a pepo because of its thick outer rind. He also considers the banana (Musa) to be pepo. The pomegranate has a persistant calyx and endocarp reminiscent of a pome, and membranous partitions, juicy seed vesicles, and a leathery exocarp similar to a hesperidium. Spjut classifies the pomegranate as a "balusta." Berry-like fruits, such as the avocado (Persea) and kiwi (Actinidia) are called a "bacca." Unusual Fruit Of The Pomegranate

Abstract Utilization of neuropharmaceuticals for central nervous system(CNS) disease is highly limited due to the blood-brain barrier(BBB) which restricts molecules larger than 500Da from reaching the CNS. The development of a reliable method to bypass the BBB would represent an enormous advance in neuropharmacology enabling the use of many potential disease modifying therapies. Previous attempts such as transcranial catheter implantation have proven to be temporary and associated with multiple complications. Here we describe a novel method of creating a semipermeable window in the BBB using purely autologous tissues to allow for high molecular weight(HMW) drug delivery to the CNS. This approach is inspired by recent advances in human endoscopic transnasal skull base surgical techniques and involves engrafting semipermeable nasal mucosa within a surgical defect in the BBB. The mucosal graft thereby creates a permanent transmucosal conduit for drugs to access the CNS. The main objective of this study was to develop a murine model of this technique and use it to evaluate transmucosal permeability for the purpose of direct drug delivery to the brain. Using this model we demonstrate that mucosal grafts allow for the transport of molecules up to 500 kDa directly to the brain in both a time and molecular weight dependent fashion. Markers up to 40 kDa were found within the striatum suggesting a potential role for this technique in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. This proof of principle study demonstrates that mucosal engrafting represents the first permanent and stable method of bypassing the BBB thereby providing a pathway for HMW therapeutics directly into the CNS.

We first heard rumors of this policy change a couple of months ago, but now it's made the papers: the Financial Times is reporting that Google is phasing out the use of Windows internally, as employees are migrated to either Linux or Mac OS X on machine turnovers or new hires. The policy change was precipitated in large part by the security breach attributed to Chinese hackers; Google's IT leaders apparently feel that Microsoft's OS represents too great a risk across the enterprise to leave it in place.

There's no way around the fact that Marvel's Netflix Iron Fist had the highest hill to climb of the four Defenders . Daredevil was easy enough to sell as a traditional superhero, while Jessica Jones built off that credibility to bring us a different type of hero , whose cynical tone and stellar cast created something wholly unique. Luke Cage got to pivot into a world we'd already explored, adding flavors of hip-hop and Blaxploitation to timely and vital issues. Iron Fist has always been the outlier here, and it's no surprise that reports claimed Marvel was uncertain how to angle its interpretation , especially in light of the racial controversy swirling around Finn Jones ' casting as Danny Rand .

So, you want to buy a new smartphone? Of course you do (unless you already have the Galaxy S4, the HTC One, or the iPhone 5S). For most of us, smartphones are at the center of our lives, and we rely on them to stay in touch with others, browse the web, snap photos whenever and wherever we want, easily find our way around with GPS, manage tasks, and even get some work done. But we also know that good smartphones are expensive, so one should consider lots of things before deciding which one to buy. Remember the TabletRocket web service we covered back in August? For those who missed out on it, the service basically allows you to compare various popular tablets in order to make the best buying decision. Geekaphone is the smartphone equivalent of TabletRocket – to some extent. The web service allows you to compare up to 5 smartphones side by side, showing you the differences in their specs and physical design to help you choose the right one.

I know Greg Taylor. He is not exactly a *** artist but does have many ways to avoid being seen in the public eye because anonymity is the safest way to make sure he doesn't get caught if he messes up. He does try to complete jobs from time to time but often takes people's money without having done any preparation to do the work or knowing what the materials costs. It will take a much longer time than promised to get the results, if you get any. He does use women, or other people if he can to hide himself and will try to open bank accounts,loans and businesses in other people's names. Whether or not he is a sociopath, I don't know. Whether or not your work will get done is uncertain. He has different names and many businesses he hides behind.

Few fMRI studies have investigated the brain-behavioral basis of parenting in human fathers. Ten fathers were videotaped and gave salivary testosterone samples while interacting with their 2–4 months old infants, and viewed video clips of their own infant and an unfamiliar age-, ethnicity- and sex-matched other infant during an fMRI protocol. Infant stimuli activated a network of prefrontal and subcortical brain regions. Furthermore, a subset of these regions activated significantly more to own (OWN) than other (OTHER) infants. Finally, neural responses to OWN versus OTHER were linked with paternal sensitivity, paternal reciprocity, and testosterone. In sum, our results provide a novel perspective on the links between brain, behavior, and hormones in fathers.

Introduction Manufacturers have been trying for years to improve the gaming experience for users of LCD displays. When they first became widely available and affordable as a desktop monitor solution there were certainly limitations in many areas with the technology. One area which has always been a focus for buyers has been the response time of the display, how quickly the individual pixels can change from one colour to another. For a long time this had a major impact on how the screen can handle fast moving scenes in movies and games and has for a long time been seen as one of the most important specs buyers should look at. Slower panels can suffer from issues like ghosting (trailing images) and high levels of motion blur and smearing. Over the years manufacturers have managed to drive down pixel response times significantly, helping to eliminate a large part of the problem. The advent of overdrive (Response Time Compensation) several years ago signified a step change in pixel response times, driving down grey to grey (G2G) changes and helping to ensure all panel technologies including IPS, VA and TN Film variants could offer decent response times where it was used well. More recently manufacturers have improved gaming again with the arrival of native support for 120Hz+ refresh rates. This has significantly helped improve smoothness and the perceived motion in practice for users, as well as allowing support for higher frame rates and 3D content. One area which has not been as easy to address over the years is the sample-and-hold nature of LCD, which affects the way the human eye perceives the image from an LCD monitor. This is an area which has seen some investment over the years and in this article we will have a look some relatively new technique which can greatly reduce motion blur from LCD's. If you appreciate the article and enjoy reading and like our work, we would welcome a donation to the site to help us continue to make quality and detailed reviews and articles for you.
Last week Georgetown failed to close on yet another tremendous opportunity to tally a signature win, this time on its home floor against #10 Kansas. Despite not having watched a single college basketball game all year, my girlfriend made an astute observation in the closing minutes: "He shoots too much." The "he" she was referring to was D'Vauntes Smith-Rivera, the Hoyas' leading scorer at 13.3 PPG and the coaches' nomination for preseason Big East Player of the Year. It confirmed something many Hoyas' fans have been wondering as well: How is this the same player who finished sixth in scoring in the Big East last season? Against Kansas, in the midst a miserable 3-of-15 shooting performance, it became apparent that Smith-Rivera's overwhelming desire to shoot took the team's offense out of rhythm.

"[T]he vast majority of people who use marijuana never progress to using other illicit drugs, or even to becoming regular marijuana consumers... The principal connection between marijuana and other illicit drugs mostly involves the nature of the market, not the nature of the high. In the Netherlands, where the marijuana market has been quasi-legal and regulated for decades, marijuana use is less prevalent than in the United States, and those who do consume marijuana are less likely to use other illicit drugs... Perhaps most important, new evidence now indicates that the proliferation of medical marijuana laws and dispensaries around the United States is strongly associated with fewer people dying from overdoses involving heroin and pharmaceutical opioids. The most likely reason is that people are finding marijuana more helpful than opioids in managing different types of pain."

OTTAWA — A top organizer for both Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton is actively working with the NDP — and predicts Canadians will conclude that Leader Tom Mulcair is the only person who can defeat Stephen Harper. Jeremy Bird was President Obama's national field director in 2012, helping to identify and motivate individual voters at the grassroots level. More recently, he was one of the figures inside the political action committee promoting Clinton as a presidential candidate. He's now well acquainted with Canadian politics, and speaks with ease about regional support levels, vote splits and party records. "A lot of what you see from the Conservative policies of the Harper government are a lot like the rhetoric we're hearing from the Republican Party primaries — economic policies to help the rich get richer at the expense of the middle class, a budget that's only balanced on the back of working class families ... denials of climate change," Bird said in an interview from Washington, D.C. "Fortunately we share democratic values with the NDP, and I think climate change is just one example of that." Bird spoke to NDP party members at a 2013 NDP convention, and in the intervening years his Chicago-based firm 270 Strategies has advised the party on improving their contact with potential voters. Bird, who has come up to Canada a few times since the election began, discounts Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau as a credible threat to Harper's hold on power. "It's a riding by riding election in which the candidates have to make their case at the riding level," said Bird. "Their strength in Quebec gives them a massive advantage in terms of being the real alternative that can put together enough seats to form government that is not led by Stephen Harper." The Obama for America campaign became legendary for being able to use data to identify supporters and also other voters who might be persuadable. Digital messages and those delivered in person were tailored to the specific individual — called micro-targeting. Armies of volunteers fanned out across districts to make sure ballots were cast. But the Conservative Party is good at that sort of campaign too. They've had success at stitching together the right numbers of voters in particular ridings with the right messages, using a well-fed party database. Bird dismisses this Conservative prowess, saying the tactics are ineffective if the party's record falls flat with voters. His firm has been helping the New Democrats learn how to pinpoint battleground ridings, and then harness the energy of local volunteers and organizers — including offering them training. Ensuring that a voter's online interactions with the party are meaningful is also key, said Bird. "What it's really going to come down to is operations on the ground, neighbours talking to neighbours, people talking to people in their riding." The Conservatives made headlines earlier this month when it was revealed they had been using the services of Australian campaign consultant Lynton Crosby, credited with helping secure victories for John Howard as well as for British Prime Minister David Cameron. "The election in Canada is going to be won based on the strength of the three leaders and their ability to appeal to the majority of Canadians and the strength of their party," said Bird. "It's not going to be decided based on any outside consultants, whether they be from Australia, England, the United States, etc."

If your yard is so badly flooded that quacking ducks are paddling gleefully under the clothesline, it's time to make some choices and get things under control. You can adopt the ducks and plant water lilies and a rice paddy, or you can remove the water. With nothing on hand but a garden hose, you may think you're up a proverbial creek without any oars. Not so -- that hose is worth its weight in gold as a siphon. Contrary to what you may have heard, you're not going to have to suck on the end of the hose to work a small miracle.
Pathological lying (PL) is a controversial topic. There is, as yet, no consensus in the psychiatric community on its definition, although there is general agreement on its core elements. PL is characterized by a long history (maybe lifelong) of frequent and repeated lying for which no apparent psychological motive or external benefit can be discerned. While ordinary lies are goal-directed and are told to obtain external benefit or to avoid punishment, pathological lies often appear purposeless. In some cases, they might be self-incriminating or damaging, which makes the behavior even more incomprehensible. Despite its relative obscurity, PL has been recognized and written about in the psychiatric literature for more than a century. The German physician, Anton Delbruck,1 is credited with being the first to describe the concept of PL. He observed that some of his patients told lies that were so abnormal and out of proportion that they deserved a special category. He sub-sequently described the lies as "pseu- dologia phantastica."

60 Reasons Why the Bible Is Not A Perfect Text Written by Joe Pettit Keep in mind that I am trying to persuade a reader of this list that the Bible is not the inerrant and literal words of God. I am not trying to prove such a conclusion. The clever, although usually very implausible, use of verbal and historical gymnastics can probably get around most of the problems on this list. However, such acts of contextual and verbal contortion are always far less persuasive than the simple and single conclusion that the Bible is a human text that is responding to God in often profound, but also inconsistent, contrary, and necessarily flawed ways. Note: Most of what follows is a discussion of New Testament texts. I simply have not studied the Jewish scriptures as much as I have Christian texts. Also, some of the problems may seem insignificant, and they probably are, but the point is that even insignificant problems should never appear in a text that is literally and inerrantly from God; that is, they should not appear in a perfect text, whereas their presence in profound but flawed human texts is easy to explain. If, after reading this, you wonder what it is that I actually believe as one who calls himself a Christian, I have tried to make that clearer here [Sources: Most of the following is heavily dependent on Bart Ehrman's The New Testament: A Historical Introduction to the Early Christian Writings, 3rd edition. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004, and on Ehrman's Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why. New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 2005] Textual Problems Often, the texts of the Bible themselves are difficult, and likely impossible, to reconcile to each other. This is easy to explain if they were written by many different fallible people at many different times and places. It is very difficult to explain if the texts are from God. 1. The Order of Creation: In the first chapter of Genesis, animals are created before humans (1:20-24, 1:26-27), but in the second chapter, man is created before the animals (2:7, 2:19). 2. The Iniquity of the Father: In Exodus 34:7 we are told that the iniquity of the father will be visited upon the children and upon their children "unto the fourth generation." But in Ezekiel 18:20 we are told that "the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father." Moreover, Ezekiel explicitly repudiates the Exodus interpretation. 3. Noah and the Flood: Upon careful examination, it becomes clear that there are two stories of Noah and the flood and that these stories have some rather significant differences. Most of us are familiar with the version that has Noah bringing one pair of every animal on to the Ark (7:8-15), where it rained for 40 days and forty nights (7:4, 8:6), and that after 54 days (two weeks after the 40 days were over) the waters had receded enough that the dove released by Noah did not return. However, there is another version of the story where Noah takes seven pairs of every "clean" beast (7:2) and only one pair of every unclean beast; where it first rains for 150 days, and then takes another 150 days (10 months from the start of the flood) for the first mountain tops to appear. Also, rather strangely, Noah and his family enter the Ark twice; once at 7:7 and then again at 7:13. There is a fine demonstration of how the two different versions of the Noah story are woven together at http://www.energion.com/rpp/flood.shtml . There is one additional problem with the Noah story. It is almost identical to another flood story told in the Epic of Gilgamesh, a text much older than the account of Noah. In the Epic we read of a man warned by a god to build a boat because another god who is tired of the noise of humanity is going to destroy every human being. After the man's boat comes to rest on a mountain, he releases a bird three times (just like Noah), only he first releases a dove, then a sparrow, and then a raven (Noah actually releases a raven as well at 8:7, we just never hear or read about it). The man sacrifices on a mountain to the god who saved him, just like Noah. It is difficult to avoid concluding that the authors of the Noah stories were "influenced" by the Epic of Gilgamesh. 4. Many Languages, or One? In chapter 10 of Genesis, we get a long account of the many peoples and many languages that descend from Noah and of the many lands that they occupied (10:5, 20, 31-32). However, after this, we are told in the set up for the Tower of Babel story that whole land had only one language and that they all managed to settle on only one plain

There used to be rhinos in North America. In fact, they originated on the continent. The earliest ones didn't look like the large, thick-skinned beasts we know today. No, if you were to wander through the humid forests of Wyoming or Utah around 50 million years ago, the closest thing to a rhino that you'd see would be a slender, pony-sized mammal that paleontologists know as Hyrachyus. And speaking of ponies, some of the earliest horses wandered the same forests – Eohippus and other horses that stood on several hoofed toes and were the size of a small dog – as well as the first tapirs.

In reaction to the terrorist murders in Paris on Friday, Republican presidential hopefuls including Rand Paul (say it ain't so, Rand) are demanding that no refugees be admitted to the United States. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex) claimed that letting in Syrian refugees would be a "roll of the dice." Reality TV billionaire blowhard Donald Trump declared that the refugees could be "one of the great Trojan horses." Politico reports that at least ten Republican governors are vowing to keep out of their states any of the 10,000 or so Syrian refugees that could be admitted to the U.S. next year. Just how the governors think they have the authority to prevent people who are legally in this country from going where they want is not at all clear.
For more than a decade, efforts to systematically overhaul the United States immigration system have been overshadowed by other events—from foreign wars and national security concerns to the financial crisis that threatened to bring down the world economy. In addition to this ever-changing list of national crises, years of partisan political fighting and the resurgence of a volatile restrictionist movement that thrives on angry rhetoric have made opportunities for advancing genuine reform few and far between. As a result, many in both parties opted for a political strategy that emphasized immigration enforcement over immigration reform, holding to the argument that efficiently deporting non-citizens would reduce illegal immigration and pave the way for more sensible outcomes in the future. Instead, the unprecedented spending on immigration enforcement, the extraordinary rise in deportations, the passage of state anti-immigrant laws, and the almost daily anecdotes of separated families and discrimination finally took their toll. Voters signaled in the 2012 federal elections that they were tired of enforcement-only immigration policies and the senseless pain they caused. Now more than ever, the opportunity to craft immigration laws that reflect American values and needs is a distinct possibility. The White House, Members of Congress, and countless organizations have issued new ideas and principles for making the system work. These proposals vary and will likely change even more as proposals translate into legislation, but there are a number of common themes that exist. This paper lays out an overview of the underlying legal system, the most basic principles of reform, the reasons behind them, and how they are likely to be reflected in coming legislation.

Special Event President Clinton Announces Largest Budget Surplus in the History of the Federal Government Aired September 27, 2000 - 9:57 a.m. ET THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. DARYN KAGAN, CNN ANCHOR: As promised, we go live to Washington, D.C. and the White House. Here is President Clinton. (JOINED IN PROGRESS) WILLIAM J. CLINTON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: ... and the poverty rate has fallen to its lowest level in 20 years. Today there's more good economic news. Eight years ago, our future was at risk. Economic growth was low, unemployment was high, interest rates were high, the federal debt had quadrupled in the previous 12 years. When Vice President Gore and I took office, the budget deficit was $290 billion, and it was projected this year the budget deficit would be $455 billion. The American people, thankfully, chose a better future. They put their support behind a new economic direction of fiscal discipline, greater investment in our people, expanded trade in our products. It's given us the longest economic expansion in history and the strongest fiscal turnaround in memory. Record budget deficits have given way to record surpluses. And this has enabled us to do something that would have been impossible just eight years ago -- we've actually begun to pay down the debt. Today we received more good news that our strategy is working. According to the Office of Management and Budget, this year's budget surplus will be at least $230 billion. With this surplus, we've been able to cut the debt over the last three years by this figure -- (writes the number on a chart) -- $360 billion in debt reduction over the last three years. This year alone we've cut the debt by at least $223 billion, the largest one-year debt reduction in the history of the United States. Like our Olympic athletes in Sydney, the American people are breaking all kinds of records these days. This is the first year we've balanced the budget without using the Medicare trust fund since Medicare was created in 1965. I think we should follow Al Gore's advice and lock those trust funds away for the future. We've come a long way since then, and a long way since 1993. But we can go further still. If we stay on the path we're on, we can pay this debt off entirely by 2012, for the first time since Andrew Jackson was President, in 1835. Paying off the debt will benefit America, just as paying off credit cards benefits the average family. It frees up money for the things that matter, and it keeps interest rates lower. That will mean more investment, more jobs, lower mortgage payments, car payments, and student loan payments. This is all terribly important. Already the benefits of debt reduction have meant about $2,000 a year -- or deficit reduction, and then debt reduction -- has been about $2,000 a year in lower interest payments for home mortgages, about $200 a year in lower interest payments for cars, about $200 a year for lower interest payments on college loans. And if we stay on this path, rather than go back and spend all the surplus and get back into the Social Security funds, it will keep interest rates about a point lower over the next decade. That will be worth in home mortgages alone over $300 billion. So this is a very important thing to do. And I hope that we will see a continuation of this trend in this year's final end-game budget negotiations. However, the fiscal year is almost over and Congress still has sent me only two of the 13 spending bills. We need to put our priorities in order and put the broad national interest above special interest. The key to fiscal discipline, to these kinds of results, is maintaining it each year, year after year. If you look at what's happened in the last eight years, federal spending today as a percentage of the economy is the lowest it has been since 1966. The federal civilian work force is the smallest it's been since 1960, down 377,000 from the day I took office. I am concerned, frankly, about the size and last-minute nature of this year's congressional spending spree, where they seem to be loading up the spending bills with special projects for special interests, but can't seem to find the time to raise the minimum wage, or pass a patients' bill of rights, or drug benefits for our seniors through Medicare, or tax cuts for long-term care, child care, or college education. And first and foremost, they haven't found the funds for education, for continuing to hire 100,000 qualified teachers to reduce class size, to build and modernize schools, to provide after-school for children who need it, and have real accountability for failing schools, requiring them to turn around or shut down or be put under new management. These are the things that

Quote This seems like a glaring omission, given that we can queue for level 50 flashpoints at level 55. It also leaves the group finder depressingly barren from level 56 on. It seems like the current level 60 group finder catalog is just crying out for two added categories for the level 55 [TACTICAL] and level 55 [HARD] flashpoints. Also, the two Czerka level 55 [TACTICAL] FPs at least are required to complete the [WEEKLY], which is a pain when we can't queue for them. Since all of these instances still are green to us at 60, it seems like an oversight to leave them out of GF.

The race is turning out to be unexpectedly close, but in public, the astrologers have been all good news.

Fungus and mold can take hold in your carpet and start to spread if you don't invest in regular cleaning. Once they appear, getting rid of the growth can be tricky.

Here's what you need to know about carpet fungus and how to combat it.
Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) who has worked on issues related to NSA data gathering, has an unlikely theory as to why so many senior officials across multiple parts of the government are supportive of the NSA's activities despite a majority of Americans being against the practice. In a recent ACLU blog post, Stanley brought up the possibility that the NSA uses information gathered on public officials to strong-arm their political trajectories in favor of the agency. He writes:

The Sidi Way Rain boot is part of a "Europe direct" closeout deal we scored on Sidi boots. This model is no longer available in the US, but is sold elsewhere in the world. This boot is a great option for those looking for a comfortable, lightweight water resistant street boot. When I put these on, I immediately liked the feel. The interior has just a slight bit of thickness to the lining that makes them really comfortable right from the start. Most of the boot's outer shell is Lorica—a man made material that is flexible, durable and abrasion resistant, and there are also some textile fabric inserts. This makes for a very lightweight boot. For protection, there are circular armor pads at the inside and the outside of the ankle bones (hidden from view). There is also an armor piece in the shin area. The toe box and heel cup are reinforced as well. This boot is billed as "water resistant" by Sidi. The construction of the boot appears to be like any other Sidi waterproof style, so I'm not sure what the significance of the "resistant" designation means nor could I get a good answer from the distributor, but let's all just think of them as "resistant" and be happy! Take the "View Larger Images" link above to view close-up pictures of the sole and waterproof closure and and all the other features of the boot. We listed this boot with a $200 MSRP, because that was the MSRP a few years back, but consider that this boot would have an MSRP of more like $225 these days like the current Tour Rain boot. From that perspective this Way Rain is even a better bargain! :: Paul, 06-26-13

The rules didn't change, but what the group of *all* the pencil case sellers does changes constantly which changes the order of the pencil cases. The output is not linear.

It's blue! It's skinny! It's the Arduino Pro! SparkFun's minimal design approach to Arduino. This is a 3.3V Arduino running the 8MHz bootloader. Because the system voltage for this board is lower than other Arduino development boards, it may not be compatible with many Arduino shields which were designed to run at 5V. The Arduino Pro 3.3V still works great with our prototyping shield so you can create your own 3.3V shields. The lower system voltage also has its advantages, like ease of use with many common 3.3V sensors.

Coffee may have hepatoprotective effects and higher coffee consumption has been associated inversely with levels of liver enzymatic markers. However, it is unclear whether decaffeinated coffee is also associated with liver enzymes. The study population included 27,793 participants, age 20 or older, in the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999‐2010). Coffee intake was evaluated by 24‐hour dietary recall. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma‐glutamyl transaminase (GGT) were measured. We examined the relationship between coffee intake and enzymatic levels using weighted multiple variable logistic (abnormally elevated levels of enzymes) and linear regression (continuous enzymatic levels). Total coffee consumption was inversely associated with abnormal levels of all four liver enzymes and continuous levels of AST, ALP, and GGT. Compared to those reporting no coffee consumption, participants reporting ≥3 cups per day had an odds ratio (OR; 95% confidence interval [CI]) of 0.75 (0.63, 0.89), 0.82 (0.68, 0.98), 0.73 (0.55, 0.95), and 0.69 (0.57, 0.83) for abnormal levels of ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT, respectively. Similar inverse associations were found with decaffeinated coffee intake and abnormal levels of ALT (OR ≥2 vs 0 cup/d : 0.62 [0.41, 0.94]), AST (0.74 [0.49, 1.11]), and GGT (0.70 [0.49‐1.00]). Conclusion: Higher intakes of coffee, regardless of its caffeine content, were associated with lower levels of liver enzymes. (Hepatology 2014;60:2090–2097)

This morning, Apple's stock underwent a 7-for-1 split , awarding 6 additional shares to each shareholder of record at 5PM PDT on Friday. Simultaneously, the price of the stock has been divided by 7 and should open around $92 after closing on Friday at $645.Apple's all-time high stock price, reached in September 2012 , is $705 or $100.72 post-split.Apple's stock has split on three previous occasions, on a 2-for-1 basis, in 1987, 2000 and 2005 . Apple has said that it wanted to make its stock "more accessible" to a wider variety of customers, but Apple could also be aiming for inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average index. The Dow is price-weighted, meaning Apple's previous stock price of nearly $700 would have resulted in an significant reweighting of the index and a $92 would put it in the right price range for inclusion.As the most valuable publicly traded company in the world, with a market cap of more than $550 billion, Apple could be a logical addition for the index. It would join a number of other high-tech companies listed including Cisco, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, AT&T and Verizon.Apple went public on December 12, 1980 for $22 per share. Accounting for its four stock splits, Apple's stock cost roughly $0.39286 per share at IPO, giving a return of roughly 23,400% over 33.5 years.

"The council is using a day that should unite Australians to divide Australians," he said on Wednesday morning. "I recognise Australia Day, and its history, is complex for many Indigenous Australians but the overwhelming majority of Australians believe the 26th of January is the day and should remain our national day. "The citizenship ceremonies around Australia are all about inclusion. We begin with a welcome to country and an acknowledgment of country, and we celebrate our multicultural nation; we celebrate the oldest continuous human culture on earth, of our First Australians, just as we celebrate the youngest baby in the newest citizen's arms." Melbourne lord mayor Robert Doyle said the City of Melbourne would "absolutely not" be following in Yarra Council's footsteps. He said the "privilege" of holding a citizenship ceremony on January 26 was not something he would give up lightly.

As a preemptive note: I am not the Principal Architect of this specific design. I merely inherited this design, and am learning it while taking over. This is not a post that I am going to whittle down to be perfect as if I was submitting for VCDX. I will try my best to keep it clear, concise, and in a proper order from the top down.

Indeed, much of the terminology dates to Meyer's Utah days. The Ohio State offense clearly reflects Meyer's offensive tenets; namely a one-back power run and play-action game from the shotgun, sprinkled with reads and option football. (Disclaimer: As I only saw one scrimmage, the offensive staff may have featured certain concepts as a means to work on them while de-emphasizing others).

Ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) has been used widely as a food spice and an herbal medicine. In particular, its gingerol-related components have been reported to possess antimicrobial and antifungal properties, as well as several pharmaceutical properties. However, the effective ginger constituents that inhibit the growth of oral bacteria associated with periodontitis in the human oral cavity have not been elucidated. This study revealed that the ethanol and n-hexane extracts of ginger exhibited antibacterial activities against three anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 53978, Porphyromonas endodontalis ATCC 35406 and Prevotella intermedia ATCC 25611, causing periodontal diseases. Thereafter, five ginger constituents were isolated by a preparative high-performance liquid chromatographic method from the active silica-gel column chromatography fractions, elucidated their structures by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and their antibacterial activity evaluated. In conclusion, two highly alkylated gingerols, [10]-gingerol and [12]-gingerol effectively inhibited the growth of these oral pathogens at a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) range of 6-30 microg/mL. These ginger compounds also killed the oral pathogens at a minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) range of 4-20 microg/mL, but not the other ginger compounds 5-acetoxy-[6]-gingerol, 3,5-diacetoxy-[6]-gingerdiol and galanolactone.

Cleaning and prepping all the strawberries was time consuming, but other than that it's a simple recipe. I went a little overboard on adding hot sauce, but there's worse things in life to go overboard on. I definitely want to make this again, but substitute some of the strawberries for watermelon.

Not only is it illegal, it is a felony punishable by up to five years in state prison. See M.G.L. ch. 90 section 24B (allowing for a fine of up to $500 or five years in state prison). Note that Attorney Davis is also correct as there are two statutes which cover possession of a fake ID. However, it is within the discretion of the police which crime to charge you with. Obviously the law is aimed at serious criminals, but as a former prosecutor I can tell you I have seen people charged under the felony statute simply for possessing a fake ID they use to get into bars.

"America is not at any crossroads," Perry Anderson writes in American Foreign Policy and Its Thinkers, his 2015 guide to the rise and scholarly maintenance of the American imperium. Anderson is challenging Francis Fukuyama in particular, the end-of-history theorist who, in his view, fails to reckon with the "staggering accumulation of military bases round the world, or the grip of the United States on the Middle East, let alone symbiosis with Israel." For Fukuyama and other spinners of imperial-decline narratives, Anderson reserves no sympathy. Intellectual America, he concludes, "is just where it has always been, squaring the circle of philanthropy and empire to its own satisfaction."

Immanuel Kant was, in my judgment, the greatest philosopher who has ever lived, but he is very far from being my favorite philosopher.   For sheer beauty, wit, depth, and ironic distance from the philosophical bog, as Emily Dickinson would have called it, I prefer Kierkegaard.   My text for today [it is, after all, Sunday] is this brief passage from the coruscatingly brilliant Preface to Kierkegaard's Philosophical Fragments :
Nate Grey hailed from the timeline in which the eternal mutant Apocalypse had conquered North America. Created by Apocalypse's Horseman Sinister from genetic material taken from the mutant heroes Cyclops and Jean Grey of his reality, Nate ultimately learned that his purpose was to destroy Apocalypse. After the death of his surrogate father Forge, Nate traveled to Apocalypse's Citadel and battled Holocaust, another of Apocalypse's Horsemen. In an attempt to breach Holocaust's armor, Nate stabbed him with a shard of the M'Krann Crystal, causing them both to be transported to the Earth-616, the mainstream reality.
Is Bob Dylan trolling us? His 36th studio album, Shadows in the Night, is a collection of old jazz crooner standards most closely associated with Frank Sinatra. It's an idea seemingly as weird as his phlegmy Christmas album or his leering Victoria's Secret ad. In the '60s, Sinatra was arguably for squares; entrenched in Vegas and disdainful of rock'n'roll (which he had called "the most brutal, ugly, desperate, vicious form of expression it has been my misfortune to hear"), he represented the establishment against which the counterculture was kicking, and that made him a kind of anti-Dylan. And then there's the fact that crooning is all about the voice—making it smooth yet expressive, agile yet graceful. Just as Dylan's songwriting exploded the notion of the tightly structured pop tune, his voice has roundly rejected the notion that pop singers must sound pretty.

As I said, the new FP25 at Costco is identical to the FP30, but with one exception...the FP30 has a couple of Bluetooth wireless functions for connecting to iPad & Android devices, and the FP25 does not. You can connect from the FP25 to external devices but you would just use a USB cable and special connector for the device to connect with your piano, and then you can use many apps. But this is also true with most all digital pianos that allow you to connect to an external device with a USB/MIDI cable. Also the Roland FP25 includes the normally optional furniture style stand and triple pedal-bar whereas the FP30 does not. You would need to purchase those accessories at an extra cost which would bring the price of the FP30 with stand, pedals, & headphones (the headphones are basic cheap headphones) above $799. However, for nearly all states in the US you would also need to pay local/state sales tax on Costco purchases which would then bring the price back up to being the same as buying the FP30 on-line at a variety of Roland internet dealer stores.

Karunanidhi started out as the idealist with the silver tongue. This is the breathless story of how his family led him astray. And turned Tamil Nadu into a family estate ROHINI MOHAN reports IN THE summer of 1991, in a crowded political rally in Patna, thousands stirred impatiently as a portly Muthuvel Karunanidhi, in dark glasses, white shirt and dhoti, walked up to the podium. Expecting the chief minister of Tamil Nadu and leader of the Dravidian movement to speak in nothing but chaste Tamil, people settled down to catch a few winks before the good Hindi stuff would begin. Unfazed, Karunanidhi adjusted the mike down to his height, cleared his throat and said in perfect English: "Before I proceed with my speech I would like to introduce myself," he said. "My name is Karunanidhi. I am anti-national... I am a dangerous person to this country." ILLUSTRATIONS: SAURABH DEB The shuffling stopped. Some people laughed nervously. Karunanidhi went on: "Dear brothers and sisters, these are the titles conferred on me by a great patriot... Who is that great patriot? He is none other than Rajiv Gandhi." The rest of the speech was in Tamil, translated into Hindi by Mahatma Gandhi's grandson Rajmohan. Still, the audience listened, stunned. Just a month before, Karunanidhi was accused of supporting the separatist LTTE in Sri Lanka. His government was dismissed and President's Rule imposed, but that didn't stop him from using the situation to pull a public punch. When news of his speech reached TN, people were gobsmacked for another reason. Karunanidhi knew English?! Related Challenger Cometh?

In the summer of 1987, MTV sent a bewildered VJ crew to report live from the long-rolling party taking place outside of Grateful Dead shows, this particular one manifesting at Giants Stadium in New Jersey. Besides broadcasting the news of a massive tailgate onto nationwide cable systems, the station pumped the band's "comeback" hit "Touch of Grey" a few times an hour. While the 22-year-old sextet was already capable of selling out Giants Stadium, MTV's "Day of the Dead" report fully transubstantiated the Grateful Dead and the Deadheads from an underground phenomenon into a legitimate part of mainstream American culture, as much an '80s phenomenon as a '60s band. Until Jerry Garcia's death in 1995, the Grateful Dead would grow more popular each year, the Day of the Dead extending to nearly a decade. The director of the band's ticket office and others would point to the MTV special as the tipping point towards the gate crashes and mini-riots of the '90s.

Dates are below, and you can pre-order tickets here:
POTUS TRUMP Sent 'Secret Private Messages' To Mueller Over Russia Investigation
Angry Bird is one of my mom's favorite games and since I have made her seventy three billion NobyNoby Boys, it seemed a good idea to go with something different for her xmas gift this year, so Angry Birds it was. Things were down to the wire (it's been nuts this year), so two amis were all I could put together, but I do believe they were a hit.
We live in a very dangerous age for men. The Blue Pill is even more of a liability today than it was in times past, because we live in an era that encourages men going all-in in their life's investment in that conditioning.
With Segregated Witness finally activating on the Bitcoin network, a lot of people expected another major BTC price jump. That is not exactly how things went, as the Bitcoin price actually took a slight hit over the subsequent hours. This seemingly confirms that the price already accounted for Segregated Witness becoming a part of Bitcoin. It is a bit unclear how things will evolve from here on out, as there seems to be no urgency to continued moves in either direction.

It didn't take long for some of President Obama's doubters to claim the long-awaited birth certificate posted online by the White House on Wednesday had been altered or might be a fake.
Three little girls of a family attending a wedding in their native village in Andhra Pradesh were burnt alive on Wednesday, allegedly by their uncle, for no known motive.Akshaya, 9, Suri, 6 and Khushi, 4, were daughters of three brothers who had come to the Nizamabad district for the wedding. Their charred bodies were found today, only a few km from the place where the family had gathered for the event, and where they were playing before they vanished.The brothers' cousin, Narendra Reddy, allegedly took the girls on a ride in his car on Wednesday afternoon.The girls' absence was noticed much later. At around 10.30 pm, Narendra reportedly called to say he was 40 km away, at a place called Basser, and was going to commit suicide. The entire family made frantic calls to him and even called the police for help. His watch and slippers have been found near a bridge.Stunned relatives say they don't know why the girls were murdered; there was no property or any other dispute. The police have found a bottle of petrol near the girls' bodies. "It is a clear case of murder, but the motive is not clear," said District Superintendent of Police Tarun Joshi.Some relatives speculate that Narendra, who was not married, may have committed the crime out of jealousy. The fathers of Akshaya and Suri are civil contractors in Hyderabad. Raju Reddy, father of Khushi, is a manager with Reliance.

John Mearsheimer is having a great moment. Adam Kirsch at Tablet has followed up on Robert Kaplan's glowing profile of Mearsheimer in the Atlantic as a trailblazing thinker with a piece on The Israel Lobby as "an intellectual landmark." It includes the statement that to judge from its reviews the book convinced no one of its argument. As if the reviews did not originate largely from the lobby itself, or its penumbra, from people like Leslie Gelb who supported the Iraq war, he confessed, so as not to damage his career. Or from Jeffrey Goldberg who of course served in the Israeli army and then promoted the Iraq war because of evidence he had seen that Saddam was acquiring weapons of mass destruction.

One of the absolute most grating facets of modern life is being busy. It should be harmless enough—after all, we are, collectively, genuinely busy, it seems! But this is precisely the problem. It would be more accurate to say that my issue lies with the appearance—or illusion, even—of being busy. There's nothing more profoundly boring, to me at least, than someone who delves into a conversation with an intimate overview of their iCal, whinging about their to-do list. It's roughly the conversational equivalent of, say, discussing the intricacies of your personal Instagram followers' behaviors—and referring to them aloud as "my followers."

One of the things I like most about stationary is that it comes in a large assortment of deigns that fits all of you personal interests and it is a lot of fun to collect. I absolutely adore Kawaii stationary so you can imagine my excitement when I found Panda Q Stationery on Etsy. Panda Q Stationery sells a large assortment of pens, flake stickers,washi tape,note pads and lots more all at affordable prices. I received the lovely chance to work with Panda Q Stationery on a review and a giveaway! For my review I received a cute blank note book, a bag of flake stickers and an ink pen. The notebook is interesting, it is cartoon is style so it looks like the smaller book opens but really it is one big book, and it doesn't have any cardboard backing along the spine. The notebook seems sturdy enough but I probably wouldn't suggest it for heavy usage projects instead just to jot notes in or doodle in due to the way the spine is, the notebook came with a cute paper ruler (no measurements included, this is to help line the paper if needed). The pen writes very well, it is smooth and it keeps the lettering small which is perfect for my weekly reminder binder so this pen has actually been moved to my purse so I can use it on a daily basis. The flake stickers were pretty cute, the backings are easy to get off and the coloring is great. Customer service is friendly and replies to messages quickly, shipping was speedy and everything was packaged in bubble wrap to keep it safe during transit. There are so many cute products in this shop that I know I am going to get myself into trouble come pay day because I want more of these pens for my reminder binder. Stop by their shop for weekly specials and deals, the current special is milk pens for $1 each.

Like many IWW members in the UK I work in the public sector. Traditionally this has been an area of high trade union density particularly in teaching, the civil service and health. It is also one of the last bastions of collective bargaining power for the trade union movement. Although as the recent record of capitulation to austerity policies, cuts in pay and cuts in social services shows trade union density rarely equals trade union militancy.

He visits a gypsy camp with village girl Jenny Williams, who is attacked by Bela, a gypsy who has turned into a werewolf. Larry kills the werewolf but is bitten during the fight.

The human gut microbiota is composed of more than 100 trillion microbes. Most communities are dominated by species belonging to the phyla Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. Microflora-derived short-chain fatty acids play a pivotal role in the framework of insulin resistance, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. They are an important energy source and are involved in several pathways, with proatherogenic and antiatherogenic effects. The increased gut microbiota lipopolysaccharide levels (defined as "metabolic endotoxemia") induce a state of low-grade inflammation and are involved in atherosclerotic disease through Toll-like receptor 4. Another important inflammatory trigger in gut microbiota‐mediated atherosclerotic promotion is trimethylamine N-oxide. On the other hand, protocatechuic acid was found to promote cholesterol efflux from macrophages, showing an antiatherogenic effect. Further studies to clarify specific gut composition involved in cardiometabolic syndrome and atherogenesis are needed for greater use of targeted approaches.

Not many people know that TCL has been manufacturing RCA LCD HDTVs for the past few years, but if you have owned, know someone who owns, or have seen an RCA HDTV, TCL manufactured it. Most people have two concerns when they consider this TV: 1.) It's an unknown brand and I've heard horror stories about no-name brands and 2.) the "you get what you pay for" principle and the price. I can tell you that your concerns will be calmed. TCL is partners with Samsung and as stated earlier is the manufacturer of RCA HDTVs. The panel on this model is manufactured by Samsung, and it shows. You can pit the picture quality up against a TV costing twice as much and still this TV would blow it away or be on par with it. It will require some tuning out of the box, but most HDTVs require that anyways. Now onto the price, it's cheap because TCL is trying to make an entrance into the US HDTV market. Trying to make a name for their own, TCL is trying to sell their products at a reasonable and attainable/affordable price to prove to on-the-fence consumers that they mean business. They are the #1 manufacturer of televisions in China and have been for quite some time, as well as other regions around China. In short, you won't be disappointed with this HDTV, sure it may be lacking some of the fine tuning features of higher-end/pricier models/brands, but it is more than adequate, it's phenomenal. Also, in case anyone was confused about the 120hz issue, the T.V. is 120hz, it has to be activated in the advanced picture settings submenu under "MEMC". Great feature.

Anna H. Wu , Daniel O. Stram Springer , Oct 14, 2016 - Medical - 292 pages 0 Reviews https://books.google.com/books/about/Cancer_Epidemiology_Among_Asian_American.html?id=5aBDDQAAQBAJ Cancer Epidemiology in Asian Americans is a comprehensive volume that provides the most current research on cancer etiology within this fast growing population sub-group in the United States. The book explores epidemiologic methods that are typically used in migrant studies, providing descriptive epidemiology of cancer patterns separately in Chinese, Japanese, Filipino and other Asian ethnic groups including Asian Indians, Koreans, Vietnamese, and other Southeast Asians. A major focus of the volume provides reviews of analytic risk factors for specific cancer sites including lung, colorectal, prostate, breast, liver and more. These chapters aim to explain the increases or decreases in incidence rates of various cancers upon migration, paying attention to changing risk factor prevalence, the importance of timing of exposures, and other co-factors important in the etiology of these cancers. Genetic determinants and gene-environment relationships associated with specific cancers are also discussed.. This first of its kind volume that is devoted to studies of cancer in Asian Americans provides a foundation to better understanding of environmental and lifestyle causes of cancer in this group, identifying gaps in our knowledge, and potential strategies for prevention.

Both play havoc with satellites' electronics.

An Open Edition Robin Hood the fox pin. Robin Hood faces left, his left arm extended to the right and his right arm across his chest. He's dressed in his standard green "merry men" outfit. It has been a standard Robin Hood pin since 2001 to date. One member noted that when the pin was originally released in early 2001, it did so along with four others as a test pin for the not yet developed Cast Lanyard series. They were eventually marketed as rack pins. Disney did a couple of these types of series to find out if the concept was popular (and it was). After the tests, they started backstamping new pins with a "Cast Lanyard Series" backstamp and made the pins available on Cast Member lanyards. But this pin continues its popularity as a rack pin.

A Lufthansa flight on approach to Los Angeles International Airport nearly hit a drone while flying at about 5,000 feet Friday, according to the Federal Aviation Administration.The pilot of the A380-800 spotted the drone flying approximately 200 feet above the aircraft, FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said in a statement.The FAA immediately alerted the LAPD's Air Support Division.An investigation was immediately launched by aviation authorities, who are now searching the air 14 miles east of the airport.Lufthansa Flight 456 from Frankfurt, Germany landed at LAX Runway 24 around 1:30 p.m. without further incident.The FAA prohibits drones and model airplanes from flying higher than 400 feet or within 5 miles of an airport. Violators could be punished with up to $1,000 in fines and six months in jail.Drones have become increasingly popular with hobbyists. The FAA estimates that 1.6 million small unmanned aircraft will be sold this year, with half during the last three months of the year.Government and industry officials have expressed concern that drones, like birds, could be sucked into an aircraft engine, smash a cockpit windshield or damage a critical aircraft surface area and cause a crash."This is one more incident that could have brought down an airliner, and it's completely unacceptable. A near-miss of 200 feet should serve as a stark reminder of the dangers posed by reckless drone use," Sen. Dianne Feinstein said in a statement.

Conservatives have long viewed the Black Lives Matter movement with skepticism and questioned the group's tactics, but this week pundits grabbed hold of a new label for the organization: hate group.
On the back of Everton's triumph over Manchester United, David Moyes and several of his playing staff have been thrust into the unfamiliar glare of the media spotlight.

Those who were waiting to jump into a nightmarish world of Daydreamer: Awakened Edition will get to experience their horrors when the delay finally ends and the game releases on July 12. Unfortunately, Atlus has announced that the game will no longer be released on the Xbox One and will be a PlayStation 4 exclusive. There will also be a 20% PSN discount for one week following launch.
The RBA has released a goldmine of analysis on how overvalued is the Australian dollar following a freedom on information request (God knows why this is not on the public record anyway. The market response was obvious though brief, above).
Even today, World of Tanks is still one of the biggest free-to-play games on the PC and console market, more than six years after the original launch. The game is free-to-play and available right now on Xbox 360, Xbox One and PlayStation 4. However, what about the Switch? Is there any chance of a port of the game to Nintendo's hybrid console? It seems, that there is indeed, although there are some warnings about it. Speaking in an interview published by GamesTM (#191), Wargaming's Senior Game Designer Darold Higa told: "Everybody is asking me this question, and it is not like we do not have many Switches in the office. Because World of Tanks is free-to-play and because we do not have an 'in' on that ecosystem we have to see what the install base is. It has to reach a certain install base before we can include it [in our plans]. The way it works is that, because we are not selling a retail product, we do need a large number of players to support the cost of implementing the platform. It is more just a question of; we have to have an economically viable product. That is why we have to watch the numbers real closely, and the executive team is always keeping track." Still, could it even run on the hardware? It seems that it is not much of an issue. "Our engineers would spend the time to make it work. However, that is the thing; we have to make sure that we have enough budget to make sure that they can spend the time to make it work. After all, the game launched on Xbox 360 in 2014, so there's a good chance the Nintendo Switch can handle it. Let's not forget either, that World of Tanks also recently got the first single player/two player narrative driven mission from the War Stories expansion, which is going to be exclusive to consoles. The game will be updated to fully support the Xbox One X when it launches on November 7th.

North Korea's hostile response to the U.S. decision to label the isolated country a terrorist state was alarming to many on Wednesday—but critics of the Trump administration's aggressive approach to foreign policy were not surprised by Pyongyang's statement, having warned that further antagonizing North Korea was both dangerous and unproductive.
FCC Proposal Would Limit What Internet Providers Can Do With Users' Data
For those liberals who fear what a Donald Trump presidency will look like, Thursday brought no comfort—only horrifying confirmation. According to The Hill, Trump's administration is preparing to slash basically every program Democrats covet from the budget—including, but not limited to, energy-efficiency programs, initiatives geared toward preventing domestic violence, and civil rights programs. Also on the chopping block? The National Endowment for the Arts (N.E.A.) and the National Endowment for the Humanities (N.E.H.) would be eliminated entirely, and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (C.P.B.)—which, in part, funds PBS—would be privatized.
Since the first day of this year, thousands of otherwise law-abiding Connecticut residents - at least 20,000 and maybe as many as 100,000 - have become criminals. They have broken a new state law that required owners of military-style rifles and high capacity magazines to register them with the State Police by last Dec. 31. Not quite 50,000 rifles were registered by the deadline but that could be as little as 15 percent of the now illegal assault rifles in Connecticut, according to the state-based National Shooting Sports Foundation, which is familiar with industry sales.

Surrender yourself to nothingness - on the Dachstein glacier
Matthew Crain, 35, was shot and arrested by police after he allegedly killed his roommate and her daughter's 17-year-old boyfriend
think of the Transporter movies, although to be fair Riding Bean did it first. The driver is known by the rather silly alias "The Road Buster" although his real name is "Bean Bandit". You know you have a quality show when your MCs legal name sounds like some kind of ethnic slur! Bean Bandit is an 80s action hero taken to the extreme. He gets shot in the head and then has his head smashed by a car into another car, but this doesn't even slow him down! At one point he stuffs walnuts in his mouth like a squirrel, just so he can impress the audience by breaking them all with his freakishly large incisors. He is also frequently accompanied by a stock sound effect of dynamite exploding...even when nothing exploded. Seriously, this happens when he rips a car door off its hinges and happens again when he stops a speeding car with his bare hands and lifts it over his head! Bean Bandit is drawn to look like Rambo, although according to Sonada he was supposed to be Native American. I guess that's why he has the battle scars resembling warpaint and somehow can throw Bowie knives straight through cars. I like to pretend he is the bastard son of Vulcan Raven from MGS.Riding Bean starts by showing one of Bean's typical jobs, but little does he know that his employers were actually women in disguise with really good masks and amazing voice talent! This is important because the next day, a guy drops off a young girl at Bean's apartment and tells Bean to" get her back to her father's mansion" before being shot and killed by an unknown assailant. Bean and his partner Rally Vincent, who is blonde in this incarnation, put the little girl in the car and speed off to make the delivery. However, it turns out the man faked his death with blood packets and was actually the same master of disguise from the previous night! She kidnapped a billionaire's daughter and gave the police a picture of Bean taken the previous night in order to frame him. This was all a distraction so that she could kidnap the billionaire himself. Bean is pursued by an incompetent policeman who is TOTALLY not Inspector Zenigata from Lupin the 3rd (can you taste that sarcasm yet). However, Bean figures out the disguise master's idiotic plan with the power of deus ex machina bullshit and saves the day!While Gunsmith Cats had genuinely great action scenes and fight choreography, Riding Bean...not so much! It has some scenes that are comedic like Bean throwing a knife straight though one end of a car and out the other, but Riding Bean is more "so stupid it's hilarious" than actually good action. The plot feels even stupider than the one in Gunsmith Cats, which is saying a lot, and the characters feel very cardboard.Voice Acting:HOLY SHIT! I have watched some terrible dubs, but this one might just dethrone Cipher for the worst English dub in history. Usually even the worst voice actors have been in a few different anime. The cast of fucking Garzey's Wing and Madbull 34 all starred in multiple anime. Even the actors in Dark Cat at least voiced hentai both before and after working on that piece of garbage. The ENTIRE English cast of Riding Bean all had never worked in anime before and never did again! Like Cipher, these were people that seemed to have been pulled off the street at random! However, with Cipher they just have highly wooden delivery and sound like their English isn't very good. Riding Bean is an anime where the main character sounds like he was voiced by a drunken hobo who couldn't quite decide if he wanted to impersonate Elvis Presley or Billy Bob Thornton! In Cipher the characters mumbled through lines with their own voices, but Riding Bean has these street extras garbling through lines while failing hilariously to pull off an accent or overact the shit out of every line! There are 3rd grade plays that are performed WAY better than Riding Bean!Soundtrack:Much like its fellow dub abomination Cipher, Riding Bean features a very cheesy 80s soundtrack that will be sure to provide a few laughs at its expense.Art:The art and animation is vastly inferior to Gunsmith Cats because this OVA was on a very low budget. One of the artists on board was the infamous Satoshi Urushihara, but the only scene with tits looks...odd. I'm not sure if the characters were supposed to be wearing very thin, skin colored body suits or if the art wasn't quite finished and yet they put it in anyways. Perhaps Satoshi tried to draw tits despite being told not to and it is unfinished because they literally dragged him away from his animation desk while he was still working!Overall:This anime is a fucking train wreck! I can't give it a lower score though because it is so unintentionally funny! God bless the 1980s, when an anime could be made on virtually zero budget and licensed in the US by a tiny company who only licensed 15

The sprawling slum that towers over Rio de Janeiro is one of the most dangerous places on Earth, and as the head of Rio's BOPE (Special Police Operations Battalion), Captain Nascimento (Wagner Moura) has seen his share of intense situations. When a BOPE mission to stop a jail riot ends in violence, Nascimento finds his job on the line--and BOPE accused of a massacre by human rights activists. But a public fed up with the violence and gangs that plague Rio loves it, and Nascimento finds himself embraced as a hero who gets results. With elections around the corner, he's promoted to Sub-Secretary of Intelligence. In his powerful new post, Nascimento strengthens BOPE and brings the drug gangs that run the slum to their knees-- only to come to the sobering realization that by doing so, he's only made things easier for the corrupt cops and dirty politicians who are truly running the game. After years in the trenches, Nascimento now finds that his new enemies are much more dangerous and, even worse, sitting at desks just down the hall. -- (C) Official Site

Joseph Pujol, a man of singular talent, was born in Marseilles, France in 1857. In his early youth it became clear that he was a natural entertainer, singing, dancing, and performing for his parents' house guests. He had a love for music, and over the years he became handy with a trombone, but it was a different wind instrument that led to his eventual fame and fortune.

The United Nations has designated Friday a worldwide day of zero tolerance on FGM, and called for concrete action to be taken against the cutting of girls and women. This follows 12 months of historic change and growing awareness of the practice.
The Humane Society of the United States has filed legal complaints with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleging that Hillandale Farms, a Costco egg supplier, has deceived consumers with its poor animal welfare standards and "filthy and unsanitary conditions," resulting in food safety concerns. The complaints come weeks after the Humane Society released an undercover video apparently showing egg-laying hens living in filthy conditions, often cramped in cages and standing on top of other hens that had died. The footage also shows what appear to be piles of broken, rotting eggs lying on the floors of the egg-laying facility. The imagery draws a sharp contrast to the depictions of hens roaming freely in a pasture on the Hillandale label, the Humane Society said. "It's unconscionable to mislead Costco consumers with false depictions of how those eggs were produced," said Jonathan Lovvorn, senior vice president and chief counsel for animal protection litigation at the Humane Society, in a written statement. Days after the video became public, Hillandale Farms and Costco released statements disputing the allegations, saying that the undercover employee who shot the footage compromised their animal welfare standards. According to Hillandale, the employee who shot the video was the primary caretaker assigned to the barn and neglected their duties in order to misrepresent the farm's conditions. Costco backed up the farm, saying that it had inspected Hillandale's facilities and confirmed that the egg producer was "behaving appropriately." Hillandale Farms was formerly owned by DeCoster Egg Farms, which was linked to nearly 2,000 Salmonella illnesses in 2010 in a massive outbreak. In April of this year, two company executives, Austin "Jack" DeCoster and his son Peter DeCoster, were sentenced to three months in jail for shipping adulterated food. In 2007, Costco pledged to transition to selling only cage-free eggs, but the company has still not set a timetable for when that change would occur. The company says it sells more than 50 million cage-free eggs each year.

I can't believe I'm coming close to the end of my Christmas manicures!  Seriously, this is the second to last one before the big day!  Well, that might be a lie.  As I sit here typing this post up, I'm realizing that since my posts are at least one manicure a head of the posting, I may end up with no manicure for Christmas.  This means I might be bringing you a Christmas Eve and Christmas Day post!  For you new readers, I post to the blog every three days.  This post goes up on the 22nd (obviously), then I'd have one for the 25th, 28th, and 31st.  The manicure I'm painting for the 25th as it seems was painted on 12/19, and well lets face it, no manicure will last on me from the 19th to the 25th!  So yup, you may be in for some extra posting!! Okay, enough of that rant, onto my nails!  What does every little child think of when they think of Christmas?  Yup, Santa Claus!  I needed to have the jolly ol' fella on my nails!  I have received so many compliments on them, and my two nephews were in love with them!  This manicure I did last year, again when I was new to blogging.  I'm going to start off by saying how much I love this years nails over last years!  I'll let you be the judge!  Please excuse my last photo with it's random colors.  It's orangier than I would have liked, but it showed the thumb art the best!
Friday night on Fox News' The First 100 Days, host Martha MacCallum interviewed the attorneys defending one of the illegal immigrants accused of raping a 14-year-old girl at Rockville High School, just over a week ago. The two lawyers defending 17-year-old Jose Montano blasted what they called the "sensationalized" coverage of the story, (despite the media blackout of its coverage). The primary defense attorney even blamed Trump's immigration policies for spurring undue outrage at the story.
A few weeks ago we launched our new webmail service for all users at FastMail. Once being used by a wider audience, we of course received reports of a few edge cases our testing hadn't managed to uncover. One of the more interesting issues we discovered came from this use case: our user liked to scroll down his inbox, opening each email he wanted to read in a new tab in the background. Then he would go through the tabs, closing each one as he was done with it. So far, so good. Except, in Chrome, his browser of choice, as soon as about 5 tabs were open, the rest failed to load, and the earlier ones then started having communication errors as well.

Busy, busy, busy!  The other day my daughter wanted to "help" me with one of my projects.  I love when my kids help me.  We were in the garage spray painting some wood.   I gave her a job of spray painting some tiny clothespins.  I ran inside to grab something, came back and squatted down to finish spray painting.  What I didn't know is my daughter had set her can of dark brown spray paint right under me (on accident).  I sat on the thing just enough for it to spray paint all over my rear.  Only me!

On September 15, 2009, Ohio death row inmate Romell Broom was scheduled for execution (left, and below right after the execution attempt). After his final appeals were denied, the state prepared to execute Broom. The execution team began searching for suitable veins to insert an IV for lethal injection. However, after two hours, they were unable to complete the process. At one point, Broom offered to move around so the guards could find a second suitable vein, but it was to no avail. The execution was called off. A timeline of Broom's execution is here. A stay was granted for one week, and further stays were granted by the courts to consider whether it would be constitutional to attempt his execution a second time.

Once upon a time, Vox was a great app. It was the only one offering a parametric EQ. But then they bundled the EQ in with their subscription service. Ugh. I'd pay $50 for the Vox app to have that. But $50 a year with a zillion features that I don't need? Nah. That is the antiquated cable tv model everyone hates. Please - separate the app from the sub features and let those who don't need all the cloud feature just buy the app.UPDATE - RESPONSE TO DEVELOPER'S RESPONSE:I appreciate the developer's review, but my review stands. A core function of this software that you offered for free was removed and put in the subscription version. I've said I'd gladly pay once for a version that has the EQ. I don't need all the other bells and whistles. Please come up with a third buying option. One that doesn't require a subscription. Just make it a player with the EQ, as the version I have on my iOS9 devices has. I'll pay for that. Once. And if you significantly upgrade, I'll pay for an upgrade if I think I need it. Please. For now, I am forever locked into listening on older devices. And that's OK, but they won't last forever. So, I implore you to please simply move the EQ function back over the threshold to the free version. Those of us that are older, on fixed incomes, and have hearing loss need to be able to tailor the sound without feeling as if we are being held hostage to a subscription scheme.Hi, we're working hard to find the perfect balance and to have enough resources to continue development & making our customers satisfied with price + product.I believe you know that the work costs money.

Across men and women alike, the data show that the optimal number of partners is one.

Warlord A warrior can learn much from history, for war stains its pages. Every conflict that has erupted between peoples, every battle that forged an empire, and every failure that led to that empire's fall prove instructive to those who study them. The warlord is a military leader, a skilled commander gifted with tactical genius, keen insight, an inspiring personality, or some other asset that convinces others to follow him or her into danger. Warlords draw from their experiences and the maneuvers and tactics used by their predecessors to dictate a battle's terms. Their commands compel others to action. Their plans can shatter an enemy's offensive. Even their mere words can stir hearts and ease wounds. With a warlord in charge, there's little an adventuring group cannot do. Each warlord earns the right to command because he or she has a special talent. Tactical genius is enough for most. Others have personalities so strong they can convince others to adopt their cause. Some warlords favor brash action, while others have a knack for finding more subtle solutions to problems. Whatever form a warlord's leadership ability takes, it improves and emboldens those who fight at his or her side. Some warlords are chieftains who work to raise their standing through their accomplishments in the field. Others take up the profession because they feel called to fight for some noble end and to attract like-minded people to fight at their side. Warlords can be found among mercenary bands, scouts, military units, militias, and just about anywhere where warriors gather to fight. Creating a Warlord As you build your Warlord, think about two related elements of your character's background: Where did you get your combat training, and what set you apart from the mundane warriors around you? Were you particularly ruthless? Did you get extra help from a mentor, perhaps because of your exceptional dedication? What drove you to this training in the first place? A threat to your homeland, a thirst for revenge, or a need to prove yourself might all have been factors. You might have enjoyed formal training in a noble's army or in a local militia. Perhaps you trained in a war academy, learning strategy, tactics, and military history. Or you might be self-taught—unpolished but well tested. Did you take up the sword as a way to escape the limits of life on a farm, or are you following a proud family tradition? Where did you acquire your weapons and armor? They might have been military issue or family heirlooms, or perhaps you scrimped and saved for years to buy them. Your armaments are now among your most important possessions—the only things that stand between you and death's embrace The Warlord Level Proficiency Bonus Features 1st +2 Inspiring Word (one use) 2nd +2 Warlord's Favor, Fighting Style 3rd +2 Commander's Discipline 4th +2 Ability Score Improvement 5th +3 Extra attack 6th +3 Commander's Discipline feature 7th +3 Inspiring Word (two uses) 8th +3 Ability Score Improvement 9th +4 Heroic Resolve (one use) 10th +4 Commander's Discipline feature 11th +4 Inspiring Fervor 12th +4 Ability Score Improvement 13th +5 Commanding Presence 14th +5 Knight's Move 15th +5 Heroic Resolve (two uses) 16th +5 Ability Score Improvement 17th +6 Bolstered Inspiration 18th +6 Commander's Discipline feature 19th +6 Ability Score Improvement 20th +6 Crescendo of Violence Quick Build You can make a warlord quickly by following these suggestions.

It's a brilliant meditation on liberal denial.  The Beach also serves as something of a nostalgia fest for those of us born at the tail end of 'Generation X' and that includes Leonardo DiCaprio, the main star of The Beach.  Set just before 9,11 and before beheading Europeans wherever they could be found outside of the West became a trend, The Beach harks back to a time when middle class 'Gen Xers' could trot around the world in search of the 'authentic', away from the consumerist tedium of high capitalism which had reduced their own cultures to shopping malls and warehouse space.   Enlightenment and spiritual fulfilment, they believed, was to be found within the jungles of India, the beaches of Thailand or the ruined Archaeology of central American native tribes rather than the pay as you go Cathedrals of Europe or the beer belly and tattoo'd idiocy of the Spanish resort. DiCaprio's 'Richard' fits perfectly into the stereotype of the early 20's white middle class male in search of something more, something ''off the beaten track'' and after some rather tedious plot points and story arcs he finds it, an island, a whole community of white middle class liberal types just like himself.  This, then, is the central pitch of Boyle's film, based on a novel by Alex Garland, The Beach is actually a lagoon on a remote island off Thailand where a small, secretive community of European backpackers, and a token black male, have set out to create their very own paradise on earth.  Upon arrival with a young French couple he picked up along the way, Richard informs us via a voice over that the island did not have ''an ideology or shit like that'', the community on the island has no work ethic, no real moral code, no religion, no laws and no real compulsion to do anything accept smoke dope, have sex and sunbathe. 
I have to admit that I really do like this story. Over the weekend there's been some rather breathless speculation about how a gold bar has been found, one that has been drilled out and filled with tungsten.

His whole body is almost completely hidden by a long dark rumpled cloak, full of holes and partially ripped. A hood covers his head, eyes and nose. Two big holes nearby the eyes allow him to see; also, the hood is adorned with purple arched curves. His cracked lips are the only thing visible under his hood. The right part of Ahrmio's body is consumed by the Black Mist. His clothes are partially burned, his right eye is green and blue, the left one is green. Mostly from the right of his mouth, whenever he speaks, cerulean flames erupt like there's a blaze inside Ahrmio's body. Both his gaunt arms are wrapped in a consumed bandage. The left arm is usually hidden under his cloak; the right one is raised to the shoulder's height. Almost invisible threads, strictly entangled to Ahrmio's right arm, come out from under the cloak and run to the open palm of the hand, turned upwards. These threads, intertwined with Ahrmio's fingers, go up to the sky. The threads fall down onto Bryn Dane, Ahrmio's marionette. A red line cuts Bryn Dane's body in two separate halves. The one on the right has female treats: a smaller arm, the carved eyes have longer eyelashes, a breast on the chest is hidden by a white patched dress, secured with a thick rugged nail. The left part of Bryn Dane has masculine features carved on the face and the body, then pieces of canvas secured with the same nails cover the leg. _*NOTE: feel free to come up with your own fan arts, we'll add it in! Also, since we are not artists and could not create a single sketch for this champion, we welcome you to rethink his look and design, then to share your work with the community._ _**ABILITIES**_ • **[Passive]** **Puppeteer** / Control range: 6000/7000/8000 Ahrmio's soul is linked to a puppet, named Bryn Dane. Bryn Dane is a controllable minion which can be moved freely, but it cannot move further than the control range. It shares Ahrmio's statistics, except for its Attack Range, which is set to 165, and HP Regen. , Mana and Mana Regen. , which are all set to 0. By pressing the key [P], primary control (mouse click) and secondary control (Alt + mouse click) will be swapped among Ahrmio and Bryn Dane. If Bryn Dane dies, primary control instantly returns to Ahrmio. • **[Q]** **Dark Candle** / Cast range: 350 – Cost: 1 Dark Candle – Recharge time: 22/20/17/14/11 This spell can only be casted when the primary control is on Ahrmio. Passive: Ahrmio stores a charge of Dark Candle periodically, up to a maximum of 3 stored at once. Active: Ahrmio places a Dark Candle at the target location for 120 seconds. Dark Candles have 1 health and take 1 damage each time an enemy champion attacks them. If an enemy champion destroys a Dark Candle, they earn 10 gold. Dark Candles generate Black Mist, which spreads on the surroundings area at a rate of 50 units per second, up to a maximum diameter of 650/700/750/800/850/900 units . No one can see inside the mist from the outside and vice versa. A ward placed inside the black mist works normally and reveal a portion of the area. When a Dark Candle lifetime is over or when a Dark Candle is destroyed, the Black Mist will disappear starting from the location where the Dark Candle was placed at a rate of 50 units per second. When Ahrmio is inside an area covered

Is it me? Is it something I've said or didn't say? Have I let you down? Is there some way one of you shills (highly paid shills) can explain to me how we handed Bitfinex to you on a silver platter and still you guys fucked it up? I got to the office this morning and saw butts were back up to almost 600 bucks. Its gotten so bad Jamie Dimon slithered down from the top floor of headquarters, sans human suit, held me down with his scaly claws and gave me not only a literal ass chewing but a telepathic skull fucking as well. Look... the illuminati are pissed. We gave you Mt. Gox, Neo Bee, Cryptsy, a 21 million dollar Pi-tato (or whatever the fuck that thing is) and now this (Bitfinex) and you guys still can't kill this thing. My neck is on the line here boys, the lizards are talking about buying in just in case. They think this might turn out like the time they tried to squash digital imagery, The Fast and the Furious franchise and that other thing....oh yeah...the internet. What do you need from me? Do I have to make a sex tape with Andreas? Do I need to plant some fireworks on Roger Ver or defeat him in one of his pajama wrestling contests? Remember the night we butts down to 160 bucks? Remember that feeling of being in a perfect circle...perfect rhythm...the mods crying out in perfect harmony "STROKE....STROKE...STROKE!" Can we get back to those days please? I went over to r/bitcoin and the euphoria and optimism is so high they are some how organically making skull lube out of thin air. When I peer out over the floor of r/buttcoin all I see is a game of grab ass, a floor littered with empty tampon boxes and crooked eye patches. For the sake of all things great and American...please pull you're shit together.

I was googling around trying to remember the name of the funeral song for Pinochet and I found this video. The Chilean army uniforms got my attention. I could not recall anyone claiming that Pinochet was Hitler or even antisemitic. Out of curiosity I searched around for anything on his views regarding the Jews. I found this twenty year old article from the Jewish World Review. It turns out that the Jews thought The General was good for the Jews. This bit is what piqued my interest.

Not long ago, the summer suit came in two basic forms, both of them unappealing: a conservatively styled, tropical-weight wool that you couldn't wait to take off; or a cartoonishly old-fashioned style in, say, seersucker or linen that you could rarely muster the enthusiasm to put on.
"Catwoman" is a movie about Halle Berry's beauty, sex appeal, figure, eyes, lips and costume design. It gets those right. Everything else is secondary, except for the plot, which is tertiary. What a letdown. The filmmakers have given great thought to photographing Berry, who looks fabulous, and little thought to providing her with a strong character, story, supporting characters or action sequences. In a summer when "Spider-Man 2" represents the state of the art, "Catwoman" is tired and dated.
In the market for an 80 percent lower? The 80 lower receiver is a vital component for any do-it-yourself AR-15 or AR 10 build. An 80 percent lower receiver provides the builder an opportunity to complete their own custom AR-15 rifle or pistol without any paperwork or FFL (Federal Firearm License) transfer. By definition of the law, an 80% lower receiver is NOT considered a firearm since it is not 100% completed. By design, the 80 percent lower still requires the builder to complete the last 20% of milling. Typically, the completion of an 80% lower is accomplished using an 80 lower jig.

... These findings generally resemble those reported in previous literature on clinical samples, and are consistent with clinical evidence showing that TTM is often associated with negative emotional states including sadness, irritability, shame, frustration, embarrassment, and low self-esteem (Casati, 2000;SHORT TITLE: AFFECTIVE CORRELATES IN ITALIAN HAIR PULLERS 2005a; 2005b; Roberts et al., 2015; Stemberger et al., 2000; du Toit et al., 2001). Such emotional states – likely the direct result of finishing a hair pulling episode – often act as further triggers of the behavior, thus perpetuating the behavior as a means of regulating emotion (Mansueto et al., 1997; Roberts et al., 2015 ). For example, both symptom-based shame (related to pulling) and body shame (related to the consequences on physical appearance due to hair pulling) might drive further hair pulling behaviors, thus fostering the dysfunctional emotion regulation cycle (Weingarden and Renshaw, 2015). ...

In the midst of what seems to be a wave of Islamophobia following Donald Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S., yet another story of discrimination and abuse has emerged."Today. On a crowded bus. On Michigan Avenue. On my way home from a great job in a city in a diverse country that I was born in. A man screamed at me. Called me a sand ni**er. Told me I was the problem. That I need to get the fuck out of his country," wrote 27-year-old Sharareh Delara Drury, a Chicago-based Iranian-American writer and editor in a Facebook post on Monday. "I may have been wearing my scarf higher on my head than usual because it was cold out. I may have somehow looked suspicious listening to Spotify. I am half Iranian, so maybe it was my skin or my eyes."The man in question didn't just stop at verbal abuse, Drury wrote; he also spit at her."Then this man spits at me. A man in a suit and tie. Like anyone else I'd see. He spits at me and looks at me with these regular eyes now filled with anger and tells me to get the fuck off the bus, do what I'm told, because this isn't my country. This isn't my place," Drury wrote.Drury was born in Boston and is of Irish and Iranian heritage. She wrote that her father had survived the 9/11 attacks, and she couldn't believe that this type of discrimination was happening to her. Shocked, she finally stood up for herself, telling the man to back off, after which other bus riders stepped in to help. The bus driver eventually kicked the man off the bus when he noticed the commotion.Drury's post has since gone viral with more than 100,000 likes, 54,000 shares and 100 comments (and counting) from sympathetic non-Muslims and Muslims alike. Drury shared her thoughts about the incident in an interview with Refinery29.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that Drury is Muslim. She is Iranian-American but does not practice Islam.

Earlier this week I went to an entertaining talk by the writer Malcolm Gladwell, author of The Tipping Point, Blink and other bestsellers. Midway through he made a throwaway comment about the bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945. 'Imagine how it felt to be the pilot who dropped the bomb on Hiroshima – how do we feel about that kind of moral responsibility?' The implication of this rhetorical question was that the pilot must have been desperately wrestling with the ethical consequences and dilemmas of releasing the world's first atomic weapon on the unsuspecting city.

Change the way you cook an onion (and anything else cooked with it), and change the taste of your dish. That slow sautéing we do in the Tomato Soup with Basil Yogurt Cream recipe is a chameleon technique. It converts eye-stinging onions to a sweet, creamy foundation for that soup which, in turn, points up the natural rich sweetness of the tomatoes. Here's how the technique works:

On Thursday November 14, federal complaints were filed against both Vanderbilt and Amherst — two schools that have had highly-publicized, ghastly rape cases in the past year — alleging that the college administrations both mishandled reports of sexual assault and permitted a hostile sexual environment to flourish on campus. This comes on the heels of a Title IX complaint filed against UConn by seven students and former students earlier this month. Finally, thankfully, deeply necessarily, colleges are being held accountable for their willful ignorance and neglect of a campus sexual assault problem that's reached epidemic proportions. But what has galvanized and empowered so many students to take such seemingly daunting legal action?

Based on the Marshall Guv'nor, the BYOC Chancellor kit is another true-bypassed version of one of the designs from Marshall's fantastic early big box era series pedals.

It's like have a cranked JCM800 full stack in a box. The BYOC Chancellor is true to the original circuit, but with true bypass, higher quality components, and half the size.

A pilot from Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), Pakistan's national carrier, is being investigated for potentially putting the lives of more than 305 passengers at risk by allegedly allowing a trainee pilot to fly the aircraft soon after take-off while he reportedly took a nap in a passenger seat last month, according to a passenger on board the flight.
Washington—Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, today released a report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) that evaluates the suitability and availability of prison facilities inside the United States capable of safely and securely receiving the remaining 166 detainees currently in custody at Guantanamo Bay.
THE ENGLISH TRANSLATION of Wladimir Velminski's Homo Sovieticus: Brain Waves, Mind Control, and Telepathic Destiny, originally published in German in 2013, comes at a fitting moment, as old paranoias about Russian psychological manipulation are being repurposed in the American political sphere. Velminski is a media historian, and his stated goal in Homo Sovieticus is "to outline a new picture of the thinking that shaped the [Soviet] age." The impulse that would drive decades of Soviet experiments in mind control was present at the very origins of the Bolshevik era. The Soviet New Man, Leon Trotsky wrote in his 1924 treatise Literature and Revolution, would "make it his purpose to master his own feelings, to raise his instincts to the heights of consciousness, to make them transparent, to extend the wires of his will into hidden recesses." This materialist insistence on the malleability of thoughts and emotions interacted with a recrudescence of pre-Soviet superstition, a form of political sorcery owing more to Rasputin than Lenin.

Criminal Ace Connors agrees to return to New York and stand trial for stealing $500,000 worth of bonds so he can serve a light five-year sentence and enjoy his loot (safely stowed away in the cover of a cook book) when he gets out. Detective Bob Simms is tasked with escorting Connors back to New York. With five days for the cross-country trip, Connors plans for stops in Texas and New Orleans to have a few final days of fun before he goes to prison. Ricki Woodner, a con artist who met Connors at his hotel, is persuaded by Fly Feletti (a bitter colleague of Connors) to get close to Connors and take the bonds. She joins Connors and Simms on the train and Ricki and Ace start falling for each other. Feletti wants the bonds and keeps an eye on Ricki to make sure she doesn't double-cross him. After a romantic detour into Mexico, Ace, Ricki, and Simms head to New Orleans for the Mardi Gras celebration, with Feletti close behind. Written by Jimmy L.

We are a family farm near Peaceful Bay WA. We produce mainly grassfed calves for the Australian market from Angus/Friesian mothers and Simmental bulls and we also grow purple striped Italian garlic on compost enriched soils with no chemical sprays. The garlic is smaller this year due to the weather but still tastes good and we really enjoy growing it. It is delicious as whole bulbs added to roasts and with its strong flavour enhances many other dishes.

"Productiveness is your acceptance of morality, your recognition of the fact that you choose to live — that productive work is the process by which man's consciousness controls his existence, a constant process of acquiring knowledge and shaping matter to fit one's purpose, of translating an idea into physical form, of remaking the earth in the image of one's values — that all work is creative work if done by a thinking mind, and no work is creative if done by a blank who repeats in uncritical stupor a routine he has learned from others — that your work is yours to choose, and the choice is as wide as your mind, that nothing more is possible to you and nothing less is human — that to cheat your way into a job bigger than your mind can handle is to become a fear-corroded ape on borrowed motions and borrowed time, and to settle down into a job that requires less than your mind's full capacity is to cut your motor and sentence yourself to another kind of motion: decay — that your work is the process of achieving your values, and to lose your ambition for values is to lose your ambition to live — that your body is a machine, but your mind is its driver, and you must drive as far as your mind will take you, with achievement as the goal of your road — that the man who has no purpose is a machine that coasts downhill at the mercy of any boulder to crash in the first chance ditch, that the man who stifles his mind is a stalled machine slowly going to rust, that the man who lets a leader prescribe his course is a wreck being towed to the scrapheap, and the man who makes another man his goal is a hitchhiker no driver should ever pick up — that your work is the purpose of your life, and you must speed past any killer who assumes the right to stop you, that any value you might find outside your work, any other loyalty or love, can be only travelers you choose to share your journey and must be travelers going on their own power in the same direction." ― Ayn Rand

The refresh of TAG Heuer's Aquaracer range is complete with the unveiling of the new Aquaracer 300m Ceramic Bezel Calibre 5, the companion watch to the Aquaracer 300m Chronograph we showed you back in April. The 300m Ceramic bezel models replace the popular Aquaracer 500m, which was part of the range since 2010. Given the similarities between the two series it was perhaps inevitable that the range would be rationalised, but we still hope that TAG Heuer continues development of hard-core dive watches in the tradition of the Aquagraph and the Super Professional.

AMOLED displays make a lot of sense on smartwatches that use always-on displays, as no pixels need to fire for the black parts of the screen (which many watch faces and wearable UIs lean heavily on) – perhaps resulting in better battery life. It's a little surprising, then, that Motorola has opted for an IPS panel for the second year in a row.

When Manmohan Singh told parliament that Indians "must get rid of the illusion that we are still fighting the East India Company", it was seen as the proclamation of a brave new world in which complexes and inhibitions would no longer suppress buoyant trade. Logically, therefore, India should welcome Brexit and the opportunity of a new and separate free trade agreement with a country with which we have close historical links at every level. Yet, when all's said and done, India is not a trading nation in the way China is. Perhaps because of its East India Company experience, independent India sees trade as an instrument to achieve political or social objectives.
Serum lipoproteins, body composition, and adipose cholesterol contents of six obese women were studied during and after major weight loss by very-low-calorie diets (VLCDs). Subjects started at 168 ± 11% of ideal body weight, lost 30.3 ± 3.7 kg in 5–7 mo, followed by 2+ mo in weight maintenance. Serum cholesterol fell from a prediet (baseline) value of 5.49 ± 0.32 to 3.62 ± 0.31 mmol/L (P < 0.01) after 1–2 mo of VLCDs (nadir), after which it rose to 5.95 ± 0.36 mmol/ L (peak, P < 0.01 compared with nadir and baseline) as weight loss continued. With weight maintenance, serum cholesterol fell to 4.92 ± 0.34 mmol/L (P < 0.05 compared with peak). Adipose cholesterol content did not change in peripheral (arm and leg) biopsy sites but rose significantly in abdominal adipose tissue with weight loss. We conclude that major weight loss was associated with a late rise in serum cholesterol, possibly from mobilization of adipose cholesterol stores, which resolved when weight loss ceased.

Classic tale of teenage rebellion and repression features a delightful combination of dance choreography and realistic and touching performances. When teenager Ren McCormack and his family move from big-city Chicago to a small Midwestern town, he's in for a real case of culture shock. Though he tries hard to fit in, the streetwise Ren can't quite believe he's living in a place where rock music and dancing are illegal. However, there is one small pleasure: Ariel Moore, a troubled but lovely blonde with a jealous boyfriend. And a Bible-thumping minister, who is responsible for keeping the town dance-free. Ren and his classmates want to do away with this ordinance, especially since the senior prom is around the corner, but only Ren has the courage to initiate a battle to abolish the outmoded ban and revitalize the spirit of the repressed townspeople. Fast-paced drama is filled with such now-famous hit songs as the title track and "Let's Hear It for the Boy". Written by Anonymous

I've decided to start my Bitcoin 2.0 series with side chains. The story definitely doesn't start here, but proponents are making it sound like it ends here. There are a lot of competing technologies fighting for mind share trying to build next generation blockchains. As incredible as Bitcoin is, there are still limitations, and the argument is that a side-chain that allows for transfer of value between Bitcoin and other blockchain implementations is a valuable and needed innovation. Austin Hill and Adam Back are working on a blockchain company that is trying to shake things up with a new paradigm. They should be commended on a very interesting idea, a cryptographic 2-way peg that allows back and forth transfer. The question in my mind is, do we really need this? What does this offer beyond alt-coin implementations, and are those features fundamentally important?

The Filipinos' private car rolled into the train yards just north of New York's Grand Central Station. It was wet, windy, and not yet daybreak. The train slowed and Julio gazed through the rain-streaked window at the dark, foreboding sky, the cold glass numbing his cheek. Great plumes of smoke billowed out as the train squealed and hissed to a halt. Julio could just make out a group of figures moving around in the murk outside. He strained to get a better look. Suddenly out of the gloom a pale face streaked in oil and grime pressed up against the glass, almost a mirror image of his own.
This week, Nestlé brand Coffee-Mate launched four new all-vegan creamers nationwide in an effort to address customer demands for dairy-free alternatives. While the company previously sold lactose-free (but still non-vegan) creamers, the new products will be devoid of dairy and instead feature almond and coconut milk—with only a few other ingredients such as pea protein, pure cane sugar, and vanilla from Madagascar. "We know the increasing popularity of plant-based, non-dairy creamers is not just a trend," Coffee-Mate Brand Director Daniel Jhung said, "but a consumer preference that is here to stay." The vegan creamer additions to the brand's "natural bliss" line consist of four flavors—Vanilla Almond Milk, Caramel Almond Milk, Hazelnut Almond Milk, and Sweet Crème Coconut Milk—and are now available in 16-ounce containers at retailers nationwide, with the hazelnut flavor available exclusively at Target stores. The company will also launch an extensive marketing campaign on March 13 to promote the new, cruelty-free creamers. Coffee-Mate's new products debuted on the heels of Baileys announcement that their Almande Almondmilk beverage has received vegan certification, an action the company took to specifically serve the vegan community.

Is North Korea's recent nuclear test, its third, to be welcomed, lamented or condemned? It depends on your perspective. If you believe that a people should be able to organize their affairs free from foreign domination and interference; that the United States and its client government in Seoul have denied Koreans in the south that right and seek to deny Koreans in the north the same right; and that the best chance that Koreans in the north have for preserving their sovereignty is to build nuclear weapons to deter a US military conquest, then the test is to be welcomed.

About Specific Symptoms A mental health professional will carefully evaluate a person's symptoms to determine whether the symptoms meet the criteria for a diagnosis of a mood disorder. This section describes some of these symptoms in more detail. Depressed Mood At least one of two essential features of clinical depression must be present in order to suspect a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. One of these is depressed mood, and the other is a loss of interest or pleasure in activities. A mental health professional will evaluate whether a person has depressed mood in any of several ways. A person may simply state that he or she has been feeling sad, depressed, blue, empty, "down in the dumps," hopeless, etc. If a person denies such feelings, but either appears to be on the edge of tearfulness, shows a depressed facial expression and disposition, or appears to be overly irritable, then these may also indicate the presence of depressed mood. Children and adolescents may display mood that is cranky or irritable rather than mood that appears sad or despondent. This, of course, would be different than "spoiled child" behaviors. Additionally, some people may be more likely to report physical complaints (i.e., aches, pains, headaches) rather than depressed mood. This may be because some people more easily recognize physical than emotional symptoms, they experience their mood in physical terms, or it may be more socially acceptable to report physical symptoms. Nevertheless, such physical symptoms can sometimes suggest the presence of depressed mood. For the symptom to meet the criteria towards a diagnosis of major depression, a person must have had a depressed mood for most of the day, nearly every day for a two-week period of time. Feelings of Hopelessness, Helplessness Feelings of hopeless and/or helplessness are common in those who are clinically depressed. They are also some of the most frustrating feelings that depressed individuals experience. Research on the cognitive theory of depression has shown that people who are depressed struggle with feelings of hopelessness and helplessness more so than people who are not depressed (Sacco & Beck, 1995). A sense of hopelessness reflects a negative view of the future. This includes expectations of personal dissatisfaction, failure, and a continuation of pain and difficulty-- a belief that nothing will get better. Feelings of helplessness reflect a negative view of the self. Depressed individuals view themselves more negatively, their self-esteem suffers, and they have little or no self-confidence. They do not believe they have any control or that they can help themselves to feel better. They may have an urge to give up and think, "what's the use?" Research has also indicated that severe hopelessness may be a predictor of suicide (Beck, 1987; Fawcett, 1990). Now, this does not mean that if a person feels hopeless that he or she will attempt to commit suicide. This is a common symptom of clinical depression. What it does tell us, however, is that depressed individuals who struggle with strong feelings of hopelessness may be at a higher risk for self-harm. They should receive treatment from a trained medical or mental health professional. Cognitive therapy or Cognitive-Behavioral therapy often address feelings of hopelessness and helplessness in a direct manner. Loss of Interest or Pleasure At least one of two essential features of clinical depression must be present in order to suspect a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. One of these is loss of interest or pleasure, and the other is depressed mood. People who become depressed tend to lose interest in things they once found enjoyable. Activities such as going out to dinner or a movie, visiting with friends, working, or doing hobbies are just not as interesting or enjoyable as they once were. This includes losing interest or desire in having sex. People who are depressed may say such things as, "I just don't care anymore," or "nothing matters anymore." Friends and family of the depressed person may notice that he/she has withdrawn from friends, or has neglected or quit doing activities that were once a source of enjoyment. This loss of interest or pleasure in activities includes a loss of interest in sex. Some people who have had more than one bout with depression may recognize their diminished interest in sex as an early warning sign of the return of their illness. For a person who is depressed, sex may seem like too much trouble. It may even be hard to remember why sex was ever enjoyable at all. Attempts to have sex may only result in problems with achieving an erection or orgasm. Negative thoughts about oneself can also feed into a lack of interest in sex. Depressed people tend to have problems with self-esteem and may believe that no one, not even a spouse or partner, find them attractive. For the symptom to meet the criteria towards a diagnosis of major depression, a person must have had a significant reduction in level of interest of pleasure in most activities, nearly every day for a two-week period of time. Appetite and Weight Changes People who develop clinical depression often have changes in their appetite. On the one hand, some people never feel very

Many men try to achieve the appearance of having a thicker and fuller beard for a variety of reasons. Maybe they have dreams of competing in a men's beard competition, or maybe its purely for the aesthetic reasoning. Either way, it's undeniable that some men do go through issues regarding the growth of their facial hair. The combination of having too early, a less than par skincare routines, and a poor diet can make any man's beard look patchy, or just simply weak.
Astral Projection Basics The term Astral Projection refers to a process in which the spirit leaves the body for a period of time. When the spirit returns to the body, you awaken and can recall your out-of-body sojourn. There are three common types of astral projection. Meditative Many believe the astral plane can be visited consciously through deep meditation.This kind of OBE is consciously induced. You choose the time and place to put your body into a relaxed state of being and allow your spirit to travel the astral plane. Spontaneous Sometimes a person isn't consciously attempting to leave their body. It just happens. Some have experience what's known as spontaneous astral projection or Out of Body Experience (OBE). They find themselves standing outside their body or watching from above. A spontaneous OBE is often short-lived because the person panics and is instantly pulled back into the physical body. Unconscious Since ancient times, those who practice astral projection have believed that the spirit journeys out of the body during sleep. "In the daylight hours are our feet on the ground and we have no wings with which to fly. But our spirits are not tied to the earth and with the coming of night we overcome our attachment to the earth and join with that which is eternal."

Those who can afford rent live in rooms or houses, while the most impoverished occupy ad hoc settlements that have sprung up in and around northern towns such as Arsal.

BY HOOK or by crook, three parties in favour of closer integration with the European Union seem set to form the next government of Moldova. With 95% of the votes counted from the November 30th election, the pro-Europeans appeared to have won about 55 seats between them in the 101-seat parliament. The parties presented themselves in lofty idealistic terms during the campaign, the pro-Brussels camp trumpeting Moldova's recent association agreement with the EU and the pro-Moscow camp its eternal love of Russia. But that is not quite the way the voters saw them. Igor Botan, a Moldovan political scientist, says that for most voters the elections represented a strategic choice between "pro-European crooks and pro-Russian crooks".

For better or for worse, it looks like genetic engineering is here to stay, which begs the question: How will we know when we've gone too far? What's the line between scientific progress and irreversibly changing the DNA of a life form?

The agreement reached at the COP21 Paris climate change talks is certainly a great improvement on anything that has gone before (One paragraph at a time: how the deal was done to save the planet, 14 December). Whether it is enough to save the planet (to be more precise, save the human race from catastrophe; the planet will look after itself) is questionable. Apart from the question of actual implementation of even the agreed measures (themselves expected to achieve only a 2.7C limit) there are many factors not taken into account. Barack Obama says the deal will create "more jobs and economic growth". But growth, even "green growth", is precisely the problem. We live on a finite planet with finite resources which we are already exploiting to the limit and beyond. The aim must be to achieve a steady-state economy, with resources fairly shared, but that is incompatible with capitalism's growth imperative.

Increasing evidence implicates functional deficiencies or imbalances of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids in dyslexia. The associations between literacy skills and omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid status were examined. 32 dyslexics and 20 controls completed standardised tests of reading and spelling and gave venous blood samples for analysis of the polar lipid fatty acid composition of red blood cell (RBC) membranes. Relationships between literacy skills and omega-3 and omega-6 concentrations were examined using rank-order correlations. Better word reading was associated with higher total omega-3 concentrations in both dyslexic and control groups. In dyslexic subjects only, reading performance was negatively associated with the ratio of arachidonic acid/eicosapentaenoic acid (ARA/EPA) and with total omega-6 concentrations. There were no significant differences in membrane fatty acid levels between the dyslexic and control subjects. However, the finding that omega-3 status was directly related to reading performance irrespective of dyslexia supports a dimensional view of this condition, and our results also suggest that it is the omega-3/omega-6 balance that is particularly relevant to dyslexia.

Earth's magnetic field is known to have flipped many times throughout our planet's history. Its dipole magnetic field, like that of a bar magnet, remains about the same intensity for thousands to millions of years, and then – for incompletely known reasons – it occasionally weakens and reverses direction. That weakening and reversal was supposed to take on the order of several thousand years. A new study by an international team of scientists, however, demonstrates that the last magnetic reversal – 786,000 years ago – actually happened very quickly, in less than 100 years, or roughly the span of a modern human lifetime. The study will be published in the November 2014 issue of Geophysical Journal International.

This new research ties into previous work by the University of Maryland where researchers found ways to "record" biological information by sensing the biological environment, and based on the prevailing conditions, "write" electrons to devices. Through these electrochemical devices, researchers were able to identify pathogens, and even monitor signs of stress in the blood levels of people with schizophrenia. In light of this previous research, the new study could potentially allow bacteria to be electronically programmed to deliver therapeutics to a specific site to help resolve such health problems.

The following column by Joel Sherman appeared in The Post on the morning of Sept. 22, 2001, one day after Mike Piazza's two-run homer in the eighth inning lifted the Mets to a 3-2 victory over the Braves at Shea Stadium in the first baseball game played in New York after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. This night, and that homer, have lived on as the seminal sports memories of that incredible time.
Machiavelli's Ethics challenges the most entrenched understandings of Machiavelli, arguing that he was a moral and political philosopher who consistently favored the rule of law over that of men, that he had a coherent theory of justice, and that he did not defend the "Machiavellian" maxim that the ends justify the means. By carefully reconstructing the principled foundations of his political theory, Erica Benner gives the most complete account yet of Machiavelli's thought. She argues that his difficult and puzzling style of writing owes far more to ancient Greek sources than is usually recognized, as does his chief aim: to teach readers not how to produce deceptive political appearances and rhetoric, but how to see through them. Drawing on a close reading of Greek authors--including Thucydides, Xenophon, Plato, and Plutarch--Benner identifies a powerful and neglected key to understanding Machiavelli.

New statistics from the ONS have revealed that women in the most deprived areas of England can expect to have 19 fewer years of healthy life than those in the most advantaged areas. For men, the figure isn't much better, with a gap of over 18 years. To put that into perspective, those born in the poorest parts of England can now expect to live the same, or fewer, healthy years as someone born in war-torn Liberia, Ethiopia or Rwanda. And a third of people in England won't reach 60 in good health.
My ex-husband had treatment resistant depression (meaning that after over 2 or 3 years of trying, no medication or other therapy had helped). In May, he started to have hallucinations and paranoia, and there was nothing I or anyone else could do. Eventually, he decided to take all of my social security disability money and leave with the car. He left behind a mountain of debt (for someone on disability) that he had hidden from me. There was a tax debt, a second credit card, and unpaid utilities and car payments in my name (but that weren't actually my debts). Some of them, his sister and attorneys got him to pay for. But I still had to put about $3000 on a credit card so that I wouldn't have my utilities shut off, etc. I still ended up homeless for a month (sleeping in an RV) because of all of this, but now I'm back in an apartment and working on getting back on my feet. But the debt he left me - putting it on the credit card where there's interest - is killing me. He's legally been ordered to repay me, but he hasn't actually done so yet and there's doubts that he ever will. I only have $8000 in credit and what I get from social security disability every month (they had to find a new, secure way to send it to me after he stole about a month's worth). Without his repayment, I'm in real trouble. I may not be able to pay for food, utilities, my medical bills (including food and medication for my service dog), etc. If anyone out there has the means to help with what's a pretty small amount for most people, I could really use it. I just need enough to where putting $500/month on the credit card is enough to actually get me out of the debts he left behind. $6000 is about what's on there, but if I could at least cut that in half ($3000), I can catch up. I know it's not your debt. It's not even mine. Really, he should be repaying it and the law even agrees, but he may never do so and even if he does, interest and bills may max out that card and leave me homeless again. Any help at all (no matter how big or small) is appreciated.

Discredited globally (one would have thought), Marxism and its offspring and assigns–the vast array of critical theory, postcolonial studies, sectarian feminism, multiculturalism, structuralism (regular and "post"), and all the postmodernisms–thrive in American universities, where they work to undermine whole disciplines. Like the Old Dope Peddler of the Tom Lehrer song, they do well by doing good. The public notices them only when some egregiously goofy manifestation such as "political correctness" becomes briefly controversial or the butt of well-earned satire. The iceberg goes unseen.

The right to body autonomy and being free from oppressive gender stereotypes is an issue that's near and dear to my heart. I've noticed that the same hubris people who stand in the way of trans people are generally the same people who are standing in the way of the right to safe and legal abortion services for many of the same reasons. The Pacific Justice Institute, the very organization that hounded a trans kid to the brink of suicide, is also an anti-abortion group. The Salt & Light Council, the very organization that went on the news to falsely claim that trans children were scurrying up and over bathroom stalls so they could watch cis people use the restroom, is also an anti-abortion group. Alliance Defending Freedom, (remember this org; we'll come back to them in a moment) the same organization that went to Fox News with lies about what happened at Evergreen College, is also an anti-abortion group. Consider the gender stereotypes these folks appeal to as they take an anti-trans/anti-choice stance:
Statistical and biochemical studies of the genetic code have found evidence of nonrandom patterns in the distribution of codon assignments. It has, for example, been shown that the code minimizes the effects of point mutation or mistranslation: erroneous codons are either synonymous or code for an amino acid with chemical properties very similar to those of the one that would have been present had the error not occurred. This work has suggested that the second base of codons is less efficient in this respect, by about three orders of magnitude, than the first and third bases. These results are based on the assumption that all forms of error at all bases are equally likely. We extend this work to investigate (1) the effect of weighting transition errors differently from transversion errors and (2) the effect of weighting each base differently, depending on reported mistranslation biases. We find that if the bias affects all codon positions equally, as might be expected were the code adapted to a mutational environment with transition/transversion bias, then any reasonable transition/transversion bias increases the relative efficiency of the second base by an order of magnitude. In addition, if we employ weightings to allow for biases in translation, then only 1 in every million random alternative codes generated is more efficient than the natural code. We thus conclude not only that the natural genetic code is extremely efficient at minimizing the effects of errors, but also that its structure reflects biases in these errors, as might be expected were the code the product of selection.

Editor's note: The footage comes from the BBC and was shown during golf coverage. We were unable to establish whether a regulation golf ball or a 'practice ball' (with higher elasticity) was used for this experiment. It looks like a more flexible ball than the one Canadian golf champion Jason Zuback used to break the world ball speed record on the Sports Science episode , where he accelerated a golf ball to a speed of 328 km/h (204 mph).

Rito Yuuki is a bumbling boy who wants nothing more than to confess his love to the lovely Haruna, but a variety of obstacles always seems to stand in his way. One day, while relaxing in his bathtub Rito found his hands full - literally - with the breasts of a strange alien girl named Lala who suddenly appeared in his lap! She is the princess of Planet Deviluke, and she has run away from home to escape the prospect of an arranged marriage; and unfortunately for Rito, his accidental groping is the traditional engagement ritual of his otherworldly guest! Deviluke's emperor will destroy Earth if Rito backs down from his "proposal," but all he really wants to do is be with Saruyama! Naked antics, magical powers, misunderstandings, Lala's marriage-happy family and Rito's own shyness are many of the barriers he must face in his attempt to win the real love of his life – that is, if Lala doesn't win him over first!

Researchers using brain scans have found new evidence that biology—and not environment—is at the core of sexual orientation. Scientists at the Stockholm Brain Institute in Sweden report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA that gay men and straight women share similar traits—most notably in the size of their brains and the activity of the amygdala—an area of the brain tied to emotion, anxiety and aggression. The same is true for heterosexual men and lesbians.
Monetizing the huge amount of traffic going to YouTube is a key initiative for Google. Earlier in the year, we reported details on a paid, ad-free subscription service that Google was planning for YouTube, and now we're getting more details on what kinds of content will be available. A new report from Bloomberg today claims that 90 percent of the content that makes up YouTube watch time has signed on for this premium service — but it sounds like the company isn't working out deals with more mainstream content providers, like the big TV networks.

Hiking rain jackets don't keep you dry in the rain; they keep you warm. If you don't believe me, go hiking in the rain for 4+ hours and see if the clothing inside your jacket stays dry. Unless you're hiking someplace with extremely low humidity, I bet the clothing under your jacket will get wet, if not soaked-through by sweat and condensation. Like so-called waterproof hiking boots, hiking rain jackets are another item of hiking gear where the expectations don't match the results.
The first few days of the IRS scandal that would consume Washington for weeks went like this: Conservatives were indignant, the media was outraged, the president had to respond, his allies turned on him ... and only then, the Treasury Department's inspector general released the actual report that had sparked the whole controversy -- in that order. It's a fitting microcosm of the entire saga, which has gone from legacy-tarnishing catastrophe to historical footnote in the intervening six weeks, and a textbook example of how the scandal narrative can dominate Washington and cable news even when there is no actual scandal.

Obama then redoubled this unforced error by announcing an even more draconian drawdown of U.S. troops in 2014, not on the basis of on-the-ground military conditions, but with the political timetable of getting all troops out by the end of his own tenure. The predictable result was that security conditions deteriorated, eventually forcing the White House to stop short of the complete withdrawal it had promised, but only after U.S. forces had been severely pared back, the Taliban had reclaimed momentum, and regional powers had stepped up their support for insurgents in anticipation of a post-American Afghanistan.
When spacefaring adventurers think of "A Fish Outta Water", the Gillian race is one of the first to come to mind. Their small pelvic fins allow limited locomotion on land. It isn't the best form of transportation however, as Gillians are absurdly slow on land and tire easily from such a task. Rather fittingly, Gillians are at home in the water, being one of the fastest races capable of swimming.

During a Senate committee hearing Tuesday morning on Stand Your Ground laws, Republican supporters defended the notorious law made famous after the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin with broad pronouncements about the right to self-defense. "If you're attacked on the street by a violent attacker, you're obliged to turn and run is a notion that is contrary to hundreds of years of our jurisprudence," Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) proclaimed. But contrary to Cruz's assertion, the Stand Your Ground laws passed in more than 24 states cast aside several centuries-old principles of criminal law and self-defense. The following are four ways Florida's law actually flouts traditional criminal justice notions to instead encourage vigilantism, as explained by Harvard legal scholar Ronald Sullivan during testimony Tuesday:

One of the reasons I tend to focus on "organic" search engine optimization (SEO), as an online marketing strategy is that the majority of search results come from the natural spidering process. Admittedly, searchers tend to look at and click on the top results from both the paid and unpaid listings. However, after carefully evaluating Web analytics data and conversion rates since 1995, I find that searchers who are truly interested in purchasing a product and/or service actually dig for information. In other words, they are not impulse buyers and perform a wide variety of searches before making a final purchasing decision.

I've been very slack with my keyboard posts in the last months so let's take a closer look at this Nixdorf CT11 now. This keyboard is obviously a variation of the Nixdorf CT06-CT07/2 M Softkeys having the function keys at the top rather than on the left and right sides like the CT06-CT07/2 M . hammelgammler gave us a good look at the keyboard here:All caps are doubleshots with dampening rings. The "5" is the only keycap that is raised just like on the CT06-CT07/2 M. I do not know what the printing on these keycaps is. The font and overall style is the same as on the the CT06-CT07/2 M. No homing bumps. These keycaps are slightly concave, I guess one could call them semi-spherical.The dark grey function keycaps have engraved legends, the beige alphas do not.

Of course, there are already 15 physicians in Congress, and 13 are Republicans. Ralph Abraham is one of them: He practices family medicine in Louisiana and still sees patients a few times a month when he's not in D.C. His reasons for running in 2014 mirror Tran's: He wanted to fight for poor patients who were being priced out of healthcare. But unlike Tran, he blames the ACA for their woes. "You can put those patients in a box and say, yeah, they've got insurance, but when it comes to pulling money out of their pocket, they can't," says Abraham.
As Toronto grows ever more sophisticated, and its downtown more affluent, it's inevitable that established residential neighbourhoods will change. But even as revitalized interiors become more and more the norm, the idea of going the full Monty – tearing down an outdated 1920s city home and starting over – can be traumatic for the rest of the street, especially if your dream house is Modernist. This handsome new house in the Roncesvalles area by Altius Architects is a splendid example of how it can be done with sensitivity, but even so, it initially faced considerable opposition.

I was in bed with a stranger when I first saw a tweet about Frank Ocean's now infamous 2012 Tumblr post—the one in which the singer revealed that his debut album, Channel Orange, was, in part, about a boy. It was the middle of the night, and I turned over to check my phone. The boy I was with, who I'd picked up at a terrible gay club on the west side of Manhattan and who I never saw again, didn't know who Frank Ocean was and wasn't terribly excited by this information. So I smiled privately. This is often how life happens now: on your phone, in bed, at 2AM, excitingly alone with the glow of the screen as the world around you changes.

FACT is an alternative way to provide a refuge for your cat. FACT is similar to crate-training for dogs. The cat accepts the crate or carrier as her own safe haven. For cats, the carrier should be big enough to hold bedding, food and water bowls, and a litter box big enough for the cat. Place the carrier in a quiet and secure place in the house, for example your bedroom. Cats prefer to be at a height where they can look down on their surroundings. Putting the carrier on a bench or dresser may make it more attractive to the cat. For cats who already associate the carrier with scary experiences (like trips to the vet) you can start out slowly. First, put the carrier in a place where the cat usually rests. Take off the top and the door. Put the cat's favorite blanket in the bottom of the carrier. Create positive associations with the carrier by playing with, petting, and feeding the cat near the carrier. Once she accepts this, attach the top of the carrier and let her get used to it too. Once the cat accepts both the top and the bottom, then add the door. If the cat is reluctant to use the carrier, applying Feliway spray may make her more comfortable.

IN THE 1990s black Americans began returning in significant numbers to the South. This marked a reversal of the Great Migration, in which their parents and grandparents fled Jim Crow racism in the 1920s and 1930s for jobs in the industrial cities of the north-east, Midwest and West. But since 2000 the destination of many inner-city blacks has shifted again, according to details from the latest census. From Oakland to Chicago to Washington, DC, blacks are surging from the central cities to the suburbs.

The Ubuntu Edge smartphone may have missed its crowdfunding goal by a huge amount, but the Ubuntu Touch operating system is far from dead — it now has a planned release date of October 17th. That's according to a blog post from Canonical employee and QA community coordinator Nicholas Skaggs, who said that Ubuntu is "committed to delivering an image" of the OS for supported devices (Galaxy Nexus, Nexus 4, Nexus 7, and Nexus 10). That's backed up by a post on the Ubuntu Phone Team mailing list that confirms "phone 1.0 will be a reality" in four and a half weeks. In the meantime, both posts implore interested users to download the current images and report bugs to the QA team to help them get everything sorted out before the October launch. As for when we might see official Ubuntu Touch phones, Canonical promised them for early next year.
A lot of people comming here to complain about Titan without having a Titan as main class.. it's kinda fun... Titan are supposed to be a tank, that's why their strafing is definetely slower compared to other classes, just as their single jump... they can move fast... in a straight line with a single chance to change path expending shoulder charge without using twilight garrison, making them easy target for snipers. The problem is, if I want to play a tank.. I would go for a warlock as I can have shield by just hit the enemy with my sniper melee ;) Titans CANT receive the extra ammount of damage they should due their lack of mobility because they dont have enough extra life/armor whateaver that could protect them. And by mobility here i'm talking about running of bullets in the middle of a gunfight, not jump with full speed in a straight line! Or skating for the side without being able to effectively using your gun during it. And that's why most people plays with Hunters and Warlocks, as playing with a Titan puts you in a great disvantage overall. I really agree that it's stupid Juggernault protect you against an HS for exemple, I think juggernault should be reviewed, but complaining about titan skating is a joke! Shoulder charge was not working as intended before, lets divide by 3 the moments of shoulder charge. The moment the animation starts warning you you can land a shoulder charge we are having the current issues: 1/3 of the time if you land a shoulder charge you will likely ending by punching the air instead of shoulder charging, 2/3 you will be able to land the shoulder charge, 3/3 you will most likely to punch your enemy instead of hit him with shoulder charge. The animation and the time are not exactly fitting, me and more titans felt it. The worst is when you're skating and your shoulder charge dosn't go as expected is that you lost momentum, speed and, depending of your situation it means death on crucible. I noted issues with the titan jump. The jump is slower and with less reach, but the main problem is that it's not being canceled as it should, I confirmed it isn't my controller as more people is having the same issue. Having Titan as main class here.. I can only say that the whole class should be reviewed.

I was searching for a bike to add a motor kit to and after shopping around a bit decided on this one. First of all it's BIG. I'm 6'2" and 250 lbs so I wanted a bike that would be comfortable and this one fit the bill. Secondly, I noticed that this bike had generally good reviews. It also had the aesthetics I was looking for. It has an old school look with fenders and is all black with a white chain. I ordered the bike unassembled and built it myself. Instructions were just ok because they were generic for cruiser bikes and not specific for this model. But building it wasn't hard. Check youtube for vids on assembling cruiser bikes and you'll be fine. I took off all of the tacky stickers on the bike frame and wheels. They came off easy. Then I added a 66/80 cc engine kit to it. Note that you must replace handlebars if you plan on motorizing this bike because the handlebar tubes have a larger diameter than the throttle/handgrip diameter of most of the engine kits. Similarly, you will have to find an alternate means of mounting the fuel tank because the main tube is of a wider diameter than most bikes. After putting the motor on it, I decided I needed side view mirrors and a side-pull caliper front brake for safety because this bike only comes with a coaster brake which is insufficient for the additional speed and weight that motorizing it yields. So far I'm very happy with the quality of this bike for the price. It's exactly what I was looking for.

Do we have enough with no Chris Bosh and the inconsistent play of Hassan Whiteside to win enough of the remaining games to make the playoffs? Under the circumstances, is it too optimistic for Heat fans to expect more (as in winning games on the home court and against the non-elite teams) from the group that takes the court? I don't think that Dwayne Wade can do any more than he does with his minutes on the court especially with his exceptional play in the fourth quarter Monday. -- Michael, Miami
Marijuana In America: An Infographic
A committee of Ottawa city councillors has approved a motion to ban the use of hookas in parks, beaches and other outdoor municipal property.
City of Thieves aired on May 24, 2010.  It was boarded by Sean Jimenez and Bert Youn, who as a team had boarded Tree Trunks, Ricardio the Heart Guy, Memories of Boom Boom Mountain, and Evicted.  Bert Youn also co-boarded Wizard. What's interesting about City of Thieves is how similar it is in general outline to Memories of Boom Boom Mountain.  Both stories involve Finn being faced with an impossible problem that pushes him to the very edge of his heroism.  In Memories of Boom Boom Mountain, it's the irreconcilable desires of all sentient beings; in City of Thieves, it's the moral erosion caused by the toxic environment of the city itself, resulting in Finn losing his so-called "purity." That's not the only difference.  MBBM was, despite pushing Finn pretty far, a relatively upbeat and positive episode in which all the characters were decent people.  City of Thieves has a grimy, unpleasant demeanor which overwhelm's Finn's desire to do good.  This is evident from the color palette of the episode:
David Bowie has offered to write original songs for Claudia Lennear according to the backing singer, who is one of the classic vocalists featured in the Oscar winning documentary 20 Feet From Stardom.

But Manafort was able to register now (and so far, without penalties) because, well, anyone can. The law allows foreign agents to file after the fact. And ever since changes to the law in 1966, investigations focus on voluntary compliance rather than criminal penalties. In fact, the Department of Justice often gives potential violators a head's up and encourages them to register, even years later. That's exactly what the agency did for Manafort.

NEW ORLEANS—It was strange enough to see former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke, his surgically-altered face fixed in a grin, standing on a stage at historically black Dillard University on Wednesday night. But the evening would only get stranger—and uglier—as Duke and five other candidates took part in a statewide televised debate in the race to replace retiring U.S. Senator David Vitter. State Treasurer John Kennedy, a Republican who has narrowly led the field, called Duke "a convicted liar and a convicted felon" who was caught not paying his taxes. "It must be terrible to wake up with that much hate in your heart," Kennedy said to Duke. Another candidate, Democratic attorney Caroline Fayard, standing next to Duke, called him a "snake."
We consider how valid conclusions often lay hidden within research reports, masked by plausible but unjustified conclusions reached in those reports. We employ several well-known and cross-cutting examples from the psychological literature to illustrate how, independent (or in the absence) of replicability difficulties or questionable research practices leading to false positives, motivated reasoning and confirmation biases can lead to drawing unjustified conclusions. In describing these examples, we review strategies and methods by which researchers can identify such practices in their own and others' research reports. These strategies and methods can unmask hidden phenomena that may conflict with researchers' preferred narratives, in order to ultimately produce more sound and valid scientific conclusions. We conclude with general recommendations for how social psychologists can limit the influence of interpretive biases in their own and others' research, and thereby elevate the scientific status and validity of social psychology.

They have developed many plants with important and beneficial characteristics besides taste – but they taste great too.

Steve Perlman, the guy behind WebTV and OnLive, has revealed his next (hopefully) game-changing innovation: pCell wireless technology. If early demonstrations of the technology are to be believed, pCell appears to completely dismantle the idea of a "wireless spectrum crunch," allowing each mobile device to receive full wireless bandwidth from congested base stations, potentially increasing our total wireless bandwidth by 1,000x. Perlman and his new company, Artemis, are now looking for strategic partners to bring pCell tech to market. We could be looking at one of the biggest revolutions in wireless communications — but there still some big questions about the technology's efficacy and scalability to answer before we get too excited.

If only we were able to deport citizens, we could use Trump's new policy of excluding those who are "hostile" toward our country to get rid of Judge James Robart.Judge Robart's veto of Trump's travel ban notwithstanding, there is not the slightest question but that the president, in his sole discretion, can choose to admit or exclude any foreigners he likes, based on "the interests of the United States."The Clinton administration used the executive branch's broad power over immigration to send a 6-year-old boy back to a communist dictatorship. The courts were completely powerless to stop him.As explained by the federal appellate court that ruled on Elian Gonzalez's asylum application: "It is the duty of the Congress and of the executive branch to exercise political will," and "in no context is the executive branch entitled to more deference than in the context of foreign affairs," which includes immigration.The court acknowledged that Elian might well be subjected to "re-education," "communist indoctrination" and "political manipulation." (Then again, so would enrolling him at Sidwell Friends.) It didn't matter! Sending little boys back to communist dictatorships was the policy of the Clinton administration.The Obama administration's immigration policy was to ensure that millions of poverty-stricken foreigners would come here and help turn our country into a Mexican version of Pakistan.When Arizona merely tried to enforce the federal immigration laws being ignored by the Obama administration, the entire media erupted in rage at this incursion into the majestic power of the president over immigration. They said it was like living in Nazi Germany!The most reviled section of the act, melodramatically called the "Papers Please" law, was upheld by the Supreme Court. But the other parts, allowing state officials to enforce federal immigration laws, were ruled unconstitutional. A president's policy choice to ignore immigration laws supersedes a state's right to enforce them.

According to the report, the switch to a single brightness enhancement film in the new backlight might result in yield issues:

Last weekend, the 2017 Bathurst 1000 was held at its traditional gauntlet in Bathurst, New South Wales, on the Mount Panorama Circuit. Narrow, fast, and with more elevation change than some entire countries, Mount Panorama is among the trickiest of tracks in the world to get just right, as the faster you go, the closer you find yourself to the looming concrete walls, especially at the top of the mountain. The prestige of mastering the mountain is enough to give every driver who races on it the courage to grab their car by the scruff of the neck in the hopes of landing themselves on pole.

If I had to choose one word to describe Killing Floor 2, it's gruesome. It's a cooperative, zombie-killing shooter that aims to produce realism in its weaponry and environments, but all of that is buried under the blood and gore of the monsters you kill. There are many interesting things about the game from the preview I saw recently, from a huge number of animations for each gun and each enemy, to a deep perk system that makes you strategize and pick a combination of abilities to play with. But I barely gave these promising elements a thought, because, in this game, gratuitous violence masks what otherwise seems to be a good, competent shooter.

If you haven't read the books and want to be surprised by the next two movies, do not pass beyond this point.

Well after asking around a bit I've found a general idea of the final price. Assuming between 21 and 40 mugs are ordered the base price will be 6.55USD per mug. I believe this is the overall price per mug with design included. I'm going to double check with Glass With a Twist just to be sure. Inside the U.S. Should be relatively cheap. I found a box which will ship flat rate. Good news is it can hold up to four mugs. Bad news is that if you want just one mug then shipping will be the same price. This means that the final price for one mug plus shipping will be 17.90USD plus some cheap insurance on the package. Around 18.50USD. After that, 3 more mugs can be added at no additional insurance increase and only the price per mug. Since there are two different designs then this should be good news to those who would want one of each. Now I must apologize to those in other countries for I have to be the bearer of bad news. I had an estimate done for shipping to Australia (about as costly as international shipping can get) and for a cheap rate, it would cost 28.00USD per mug. This is because only 4 lbs. are allowed to go though the cheapest rate and each mug weighs nearly that in box. For those in other countries who are interested though, I have two suggestions. 1) Give me a location I can ship to and I'll go ask FedEx and UPS as well for their rates, in person. Maybe they will be cheaper. Just email me and I'll get an estimate back. 2) I can give you the images used for the mugs via email should you be interested. If you have a company in your country that could produce etched glassware then feel free to use those images. Even if each glass would cost 20.00USD to make that is still cheaper than the shipping. Feel free to email me. I'll begin taking orders now for those who are interested. For the two designs, refer to the one with wheat on the edges as "Wheat" and the other as "Dress". If you would like multiple orders then say something such as Wheat x2 Dress x4 If you have any other questions then ask in the email. I'll be collecting the money prior to shipping. I'll produce an exact total BEFORE placing an order so you can give a final confirmation that you wish to purchase. I have also been promised a return policy by the glass manufacturer in case something like the handle breaks off. From my experience so far they're bar quality glasses. I think I've even seen them around town in restaurants minus the engravings. One final note, some people complained in a thread a few days back about the face. Upon viewing the pictures in more detail, I believe it is mostly the camera quality (cell phone). Without gray scale as a viable engraving source some shortcuts are required such as filling in the eyes. I for one am extremely happy with how the demo mugs turned out though if it means anything.

If Romania is a leader in cyber policing today, it can perhaps thank a string of high-profile cases of Romanian hackers attacking the United States in 2011. That year, Romanian cyber criminals stole $1 billion from victims in the U.S., and an unemployed Romanian taxi driver calling himself "Guccifer" hacked the emails of former U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell and former President George W. Bush. Marcel Lehel Lazar accessed and published private Bush family photos, including selfies of Bush who appeared to be shaving in the shower and soaking his feet in a bathtub.

New York, 2000. A specter in the guise of the newly-dead CEO of Denmark Corporation appears to Hamlet, tells of murder most foul, demands revenge, and identifies the killer as Claudius, the new head of Denmark, Hamlet's uncle and now step-father. Hamlet must determine if the ghost is truly his father, and if Claudius did the deed. To buy time, Hamlet feigns madness; to catch his uncle's conscience, he invites him to watch a film he's made that shows a tale of murder. Finally convinced of Claudius's guilt, Hamlet must avenge his father. Claudius now knows Hamlet is a threat and even uses Ophelia, Hamlet's love, in his own plots against the young man.

To the surprise of absolutely no one, Walt Disney announced just over a week ago that Frozen would indeed be getting a stage-based spin-off and various other expansions of the brand. If you've seen the film, you know a stage musical was 100% guaranteed. With $336 million domestic and $763m worldwide as of today, and two Oscar nominations that it will probably win (Best Song and Best Animated Feature), Frozen indeed ranks among the bigger successes in Disney's animated feature film history. But while we're sure to get more merchandise and the explicit immersion of Anna and Elsa into the Disney Princess brand and the theme parks over the next few years, the one thing that wasn't explicitly announced or even hinted at was a theatrical sequel.

Following the military exercises conducted in Dagestan last month by the snipers of the Southern Military District motorized infantry, during which troops learned speed shooting at the Dalny shooting range near the city of Buinaksk (Arms-expo.ru, January 17), a new round of military exercises was held on January 27, in the city of Kaspiisk. During the drills, which were held at the Russian Caspian Fleet's Skorpion facility, 200 marines practiced air dropping military equipment. A week later, military units involved in electronic warfare and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) held training exercises in the mountains of Dagestan. The drills involved suppressing a simulated enemy using the new Leer-3 UAV electronic warfare system (Arms-expo.ru, February 4).

A special operator is basically something that comes bundled with the language as a form of primitive functionality, and which provides support for higher-level functionality.

You might also be told that the item is a 'flea fur' used to attract fleas off of the wearer's body (we'll deal with the myth of the flea fur in a future post).

Allegations of anti-Semitism leveled at advocates of economic sanctions against Israel have spurred a fight over how colleges should define speech that victimizes Jewish students. Some Jewish groups want colleges to use a definition of anti-Semitism crafted by the U.S. State Department, but many critics of Israel argue that the State Department's definition is too expansive and covers statements about Israel that should be considered fair game.
IN BRITAIN'S "first-past-the-post" electoral system, seats won at a general election are not shared out between the parties proportionally nationwide. Instead each one of the 650 constituencies is self-contained, meaning any vote not used to win a seat is in effect wasted. In 2010 over 900,000 people voted for the populist UK Independence Party at the general election. They needn't have bothered: UKIP didn't win a single seat in the House of Commons. The Liberal Democrats (the best-known loser from this majoritarian system) joined the Tories in a coalition government after the 2010 election, but over 5.5m of its 6.8m votes made no contribution to its 57 seats. Under a proportional system its votes would have translated to 150 seats. At the 2015 election the Scottish National Party became the first minor party to win a number of seats in Westminster that outweigh its share of the popular vote.

Ever since Microsoft announced their Bridge technologies at Build 2015 questions about how they work (and how well) have been asked. The tools let developers port over Android apps (Project Astoria), iOS apps (Project Islandwood), web apps (Project Westminster) and classic Win32 apps (Project Centennial) to Windows 10 including phone. This morning, the actual tools for Project Astoria have leaked onto the web and users can freely (and illegally) download Android APKs and sideload them to their Windows Phone running Windows 10 Mobile. This follows yesterday's leak of the documentation for the project. As it turns out, the tools are very powerful with the only limitation being the inability to run Google Play apps, which is in many ways trivial (this also means Snapchat will not work). Indeed, Windows Central has learned these tools are far from final and that the upcoming TH2 release has many more improvements, promising a much better user experience. Microsoft going all out courting iOS and Android developers for Windows 10 Windows Central is not linking to the file nor providing instructions on how to sideload. Simply put, the software is not finished, and the ability to steal Android apps is not something we would like to promote. We also don't need the traffic. Obviously, this situation is unique and Windows Central is caught between reporting on this and aiding and abetting it.

By By Karen Graham Oct 8, 2015 in Food It is difficult to imagine Thanksgiving without pumpkin pie, but it is just possible that some holiday tables may be without this traditional menu item. However, help is on the way, thanks to our neighbor to the north, Canada. Libby, the country's largest producer of canned pumpkin, says O'Hearn did add, "once we ship the remainder of the 2015 harvest, we'll have no more Libby's pumpkin to sell until harvest 2016." Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner signed legislation earlier this year making pumpkin pie the state pie of Illinois. Of course, Illinois wasn't the only state to be doused with heavy rains. Pumpkin farmers across the midwest suffered crop losses. But many of those farmers have already sought help from Canadian growers. "It has caused everybody to scramble and look to get them wherever they can," said Darrell Theis, co-owner of Theis Farms in Missouri, according to the Theis Farms had about 40,000 kilograms (88,185 pounds) of Canadian pumpkins delivered to them earlier this month. Theis told the Huff Post this wasn't the first time he has relied on Canadian pumpkins. "We're all in it together (and) every once in awhile we have to help each other out," he said. Philippe Quinn, owner of Quinn Farms near Montreal said, "I wouldn't be surprised that there will be some loads coming in from Ontario, maybe a little bit from Quebec." Like many Let's insert a word of caution before everyone runs to the store to stock up on canned pumpkin. If you are not buying a frozen pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, then buy only as many cans as you need. Too often, canned pumpkin get thrown out of donated to food banks because people buy too much. As far as jack-o-lanterns go, buy a pumpkin at the local farmers market, or better yet, take the kids and go to a pumpkin patch and find your own perfect Halloween pumpkin. And don't forget, if pumpkin really does run out, there is always sweet potato pie, which by the way, is delicious. About 90 percent of pumpkins grown in the U.S. are grown in the state of Illinois, within a 90-mile radius of Peoria. But according to the Chicago Tribune , a record spring rainfall washed out 50 to 60 percent of the crop.Libby, the country's largest producer of canned pumpkin, says supplies may be off as much as one-third this year. Before anyone panics, the company has a bit of good news. Roz O'Hearn, Libby's corporate and brand affairs director, says the company is "confident it will have enough pumpkin for autumn holidays."O'Hearn did add, "once we ship the remainder of the 2015 harvest, we'll have no more Libby's pumpkin to sell until harvest 2016."

Not long after I got back from my recent trip to Brazil, I called some economists to gain a better understanding of where the country stood economically. To me, Rio de Janeiro felt a little like Shanghai: there was plenty of high-end shopping in neighborhoods like Ipanema — and plenty of poverty in the favelas, or slums. There was also a lot in between. What is most striking to a visitor is how many middle-class citizens there seem to be. Cars were everywhere; traffic jams, I've come to believe, are a sign of a growing middle class. It means people have enough money to buy automobiles.

"Whatever happened to our dreams? The infinite possibilities each day holds should stagger the mind. The sheer number of experiences I could have is uncountable, breathtaking, and I'm sitting here refreshing my inbox. We live trapped in loops, reliving a few days over and over, and we envision only a handful of paths laid out ahead of us. We see the same things each day, we respond the same way, we think the same thoughts, each day a slight variation on the last, every moment smoothly following the gentle curves of societal norms. We act like if we just get through today, tomorrow our dreams will come back to us. And no, I don't have all the answers. I don't know how to jolt myself into seeing what each moment could become. But I do know one thing: the solution doesn't involve watering down my every little idea and creative impulse for the sake of someday easing my fit into a mold. It doesn't involve tempering my life to better fit someone's expectations. It doesn't involve constantly holding back for fear of shaking things up. This is very important, so I want to say it as clearly as I can: FUCK. THAT. SHIT."

Ten and a half years into the Guantánamo experiment, as it becomes ever harder for those who are still appalled by the prison's existence, and by the failures of all three branches of the US government — under Barack Obama — to close it, my friends and colleagues Jeffrey Kaye and Jason Leopold are to be commended for not giving up, and for digging away at the secrets that still shroud Guantánamo, and that, moreover, are still capable of providing a shock when uncovered, even if they are generally ignored by the mainstream media.

Farmers have been here for as long as anyone can remember, thousands of years in fact. As a local farmer near Urfa, southeastern Turkey, you've dragged your plow across this hill hundreds of times. Each time you do, you hit a large rock right beneath the surface. With each bump you straighten your plow and continue on. There is a job to be done, your family to be fed. This land is thought to have been a Byzantine-turned-Islamic cemetery. People have always found chunks of rock here, but they must only be gravestones.

Yes, a lot of the issues with the keyboard remain. It's narrow, tightly spaced and otherwise not the best keyboard BlackBerry has ever made. (To me, that honor goes to the Bold 9900.) Also, a slider design on a large 5.4-inch phone creates a unique problem: It's so tall in its extended mode that I occasionally had to hold it close to me to avoid banging against nearby objects. For that matter, the software autocorrect would sometimes fail to kick in while I was using the physical keyboard, leaving me to correct typos like it was 2006 all over again.

They come in flavors like Lemon Drop, Cosmopolitan, vodka, and rum, presenting concerns of their potential to increase the rate of alcohol misuse and abuse.

Today's article in our series of articles about Python internals' will discuss naming, which is the ability to bind names to an object, like we can see in the statement a = 1 (in other words, this article is roughly about what many languages call variables). Naturally, naming is central to Python's behaviour and understanding both its semantics and mechanics are important precursors to our quickly approaching discussions of code evaluation, code objects and stack frames. That said, it is also a delicate subject because anyone with some programming experience knows something about it, at least instinctively (you've done something like a = 1 before, now haven't you?). This rarely-formally-learned familiarity laden with language-specific nuances might lead to false assumptions and gut-feeling-led vagueness, and while Python aims not to surprise, some subtle details which you weren't aware of might turn out to be surprising nonetheless. So to solidify our foundations, we'll begin with some formality and terminology.

Ned Flanders shows off his newly purchased (and monstrous) motor home to the Simpsons. In a fit of oneupmanship, Homer decides he needs one too. Homer's credit is very poor, but he wants that motor home, so he buys one whose oil is leaking and appears to be held together by chicken wire and duct tape. With their new motor home, Homer takes the family on an outing in the woods. Homer quickly loses his way and everyone bails from the motor home just before it tumbles into a large ravine. The family is forced to rough it the rest of the way. Maggie becomes separated from the family and takes refuge with a family of bears. Meanwhile, Homer and Bart lose their clothing and have to wear leaves. Homer quickly falls into a stream and becomes covered with mud. A couple staying in the woods, concluding that what they've seen is Bigfoot, takes a picture of Homer and sends it to a TV station. Soon, the woods are crawling with media representatives, hoping to get their own glimpse. A park ranger ... Written by Brian Rathjen <briguy_52732@yahoo.com>

Abstract Non Celiac Gluten sensitivity (NCGS) was originally described in the 1980s and recently a "re-discovered" disorder characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food, in subjects that are not affected with either celiac disease (CD) or wheat allergy (WA). Although NCGS frequency is still unclear, epidemiological data have been generated that can help establishing the magnitude of the problem. Clinical studies further defined the identity of NCGS and its implications in human disease. An overlap between the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and NCGS has been detected, requiring even more stringent diagnostic criteria. Several studies suggested a relationship between NCGS and neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly autism and schizophrenia. The first case reports of NCGS in children have been described. Lack of biomarkers is still a major limitation of clinical studies, making it difficult to differentiate NCGS from other gluten related disorders. Recent studies raised the possibility that, beside gluten, wheat amylase-trypsin inhibitors and low-fermentable, poorly-absorbed, short-chain carbohydrates can contribute to symptoms (at least those related to IBS) experienced by NCGS patients. In this paper we report the major advances and current trends on NCGS. Keywords: gluten sensitivity, celiac disease, wheat allergy, gluten-related disorders, gluten-free diet

I've had some time for the 5.2 battleground scaling changes to sink in, and it's pretty clear that for a twink, the best place to be is at the top of a bracket. If you're going to be level 89 when you zone in, you might as well have level 89 gear and abilities, right?

Did the two OkCupid members with a compatability of 94% toast to some good times or did the date end up as sour grapes?
The sequel to Mod Guide 2 : Fit v1 continues to emphasize the importance of fit. Guys, the size of your shirt does not define your masculinity. If you wear a large tshirt and it fits, cool. If the shirt is too big on you, chances are, you don't look as manly as you think you do. Don't let size get in the way of looking good. Girls, tight is not always the way to go and your tank tops are not meant to be a second skin. Just make sure you know what flatters your body type.. a whole other topic.

In just over two months, we will commemorate the 10th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, a natural disaster that ravaged communities along the Gulf Coast.

Implicit in these essays is a critique of consumption as a lifestyle and of capitalism as a system that demands consumption t

The collapse of the Indian rupee is just the first of many financial crises that the US Federal Reserve may well trigger with the unwinding of its stimulus policy. Since 2008, the Fed has cut interest rates to zero and tripled its balance sheet. The duration and magnitude of the stimulus is unprecedented. A smaller reversal of the Fed's stimulus in the 1980s triggered the Latin American debt crisis and, in the 1990s, the Asian financial crisis. This time could be worse.

If any company embodies the philosophy that "literally any publicity is good publicity", it's Wicked Campers. For years, the company has remained steadfast in its mission to paint vans with the kind of vile, and often violent, misogynistic "jokes" you would imagine most people would be embarrassed and ashamed to be seen driving around with. And they've done this despite waves of complaints, social media outrage, petitions and boycotts that most companies would have tried to PR their way out of a long time ago.

I love the concept. Beautiful color coded maps of temperatures. The data seems to be based on forecasts, not live info. I use it every day because it's very helpful and I can quickly understand temps in a glance. Living in the East Bay, working in SF where temps can vary by 5-10°, this is great!!Of course there is still room to improve. For example, I wish we could have a view for Marin/Sonoma/Napa so I can plan my weekend coastal hikes and trips to wine county. I also wish the app could do more with live data easily available, but also keeping things as simple and clear as they are right now. ☺️

Nothing is worse than waiting for a game that is nowhere near close to being ready. It is a nightmare of cruel proportions. Yet, here we are, existing at a time when the genre of MMORPGs seems heavily weighted to what is on the horizon than what we have available to play right now. Sure, WildStar just went free to play and next month will see the release of an anticipated expansion pack or two, but by and large the things we're really itching to see won't be available until next year, after the winter. Now is the winter of our discontent. So, because I like putting salt on the wound, I've gone and rounded up some of the most exciting upcoming MMORPGs so that we can all gather and whine together. Some of these might not be your cup of tea, and I'm sure I've left out one or two that you're excited for, which means you'll just have to whine louder than the rest of us! But here they are, in no particular order, some of our most anticipated releases.
The atmosphere of Mars is less than 1 percent the density of Earth's. It's one of the reasons liquid water covers much of our planet but cannot exist on the Red Planet. As more research points toward the possibility of water on early Mars, scientists have increased their studies on the density of its atmosphere billions of years ago. It's not an easy task. In fact, it's very difficult to even determine Earth's atmospheric pressure from the same time frame.
We study the angular momentum of phonons in a magnetic crystal. In the presence of a spin-phonon interaction, we obtain a nonzero angular momentum of phonons, which is an odd function of magnetization. At zero temperature, a phonon has a zero-point angular momentum in addition to a zero-point energy. With increasing temperature, the total phonon angular momentum diminishes and approaches zero in the classical limit. The nonzero phonon angular momentum can have a significant impact on the Einstein–de Haas effect. To obtain the change of angular momentum of electrons, the change of the phonon angular momentum needs to be subtracted from the opposite change of the lattice angular momentum. Furthermore, the finding of the phonon angular momentum gives a potential method to study the spin-phonon interaction. Possible experiments on phonon angular momentum are also discussed.

If you want to experience Texas River Tubing at it's finest, there is only one place to go... Tube Haus! Look for the BIG Texas Flag painted on our Huge Billboard and you'll find the best river tubing and float trips on inner tubes in Texas! We're located at the beginning of "The Famous Horseshoe Loop" section of the Guadalupe River, which is a 1 mile stretch of the river shaped just like a Horseshoe! (Click here to see an Aerial View of the "Horseshoe Loop" and then hover your mouse over the river.) As you look at the Aerial Map of the Horseshoe Loop, you'll see a Bridge at each end of the Horseshoe. If you hover your mouse over each Bridge, you'll see an "info tag" pop up. The Bridge on the left side the "Entry Point" is where you will begin your Float Trip. The Bridge on the right side of the Horseshoe is the "Exit Point" for our "Short Float", if you continue floating past that Bridge, you will float another 1 1/2 miles to the "4th Crossing Bridge" and "Take Out Point", which marks the end of our "Long Float" . Floating down the Guadalupe River on inner tubes is fast becoming one of the most socially popular and fun ways to stay cool under the hot Texas sun all summer long!

Gates are placed on pipes to allow redstone signals to interact with Pipe Wire, and to detect whether or not items, power or liquid are flowing through the pipe. Autarchic gates can also replace Redstone Engines, allowing for much more compact pipe logic. All Gates are created with an Assembly Table, though it is possible to change an AND gate to an OR gate or vice versa by combining it with a Redstone Chipset in shapeless crafting. Some gates are among the items treated as Chips by GregTech.
BANKS the world over are wrestling with low interest rates. Nowhere have they grappled for longer than in Japan. Although the Bank of Japan (BoJ) introduced negative rates only in January, almost 20 months after the European Central Bank, its rates have been ultra-low for years: they first hit zero in 1999. In its long battle against deflation, it pioneered "quantitative easing"—buying vast amounts of government bonds—which depresses longer-term rates and thus banks' lending margins. Since September the BoJ has also aimed to keep the ten-year bond yield at around nought, while holding its deposit rate at -0.1%.

As some of you may have heard, Battleborn has just gone gold today! That's dev-speak for, "the game is done!" When we first started creating Battleborn, we knew we wanted to make a game with a large roster of characters. We also wanted each character to have enough substance and personality to where they could be the lead hero of their own game. Initially, we felt that was very ambitious and started off with the goal of making about a dozen characters. As it turns out we actually LOVE making characters and have gotten better and better at it and so we pushed ourselves to go above and beyond, expanding the Battleborn roster to 25 fully playable and unique heroes you'll get to command in the retail game!

OSMC's slightly belated April update is here with a variety of improvements and fixes.
Implantable silicon microelectrode array technology is a useful technique for obtaining high-density, high-spatial resolution sampling of neuronal activity within the brain and holds promise for a wide range of neuroprosthetic applications. One of the limitations of the current technology is inconsistent performance in long-term applications. Although the brain tissue response is believed to be a major cause of performance degradation, the precise mechanisms that lead to failure of recordings are unknown. We observed persistent ED1 immunoreactivity around implanted silicon microelectrode arrays implanted in adult rat cortex that was accompanied by a significant reduction in nerve fiber density and nerve cell bodies in the tissue immediately surrounding the implanted silicon microelectrode arrays. Persistent ED1 up-regulation and neuronal loss was not observed in microelectrode stab controls indicating that the phenotype did not result from the initial mechanical trauma of electrode implantation, but was associated with the foreign body response. In addition, we found that explanted electrodes were covered with ED1/MAC-1 immunoreactive cells and that the cells released MCP-1 and TNF-alpha under serum-free conditions in vitro. Our findings suggest a potential new mechanism for chronic recording failure that involves neuronal cell loss, which we speculate is caused by chronic inflammation at the microelectrode brain tissue interface.

Over 1300 people have used the aff link and I have recieved money on my PayPal. After fees and taxes this is what it boils down to: 7 x ~$55 for each member of the team $385 (free to use how they want as of now $82.50 allocated for Mrs Lumens) 14 x ~$27,50 for special involved BLFers $385 (payments started to those who reacted, as of now $27.50 allocated for Mrs Lumens) ) 14 x ~$14 for a GAW to members on the list before PMs send $196 (SB is yet to draw, so winners will e published later and given the choice as the rest has, they can use it for what they want $966 total to be distributed. Awaiting further response to PMs and emails now. If more choose to give it to Mrs Lumens it will be posted without the name, I want all to eel free to use it for what they want.

Sources inside the Senate tell me that the Republican Conference is scared to death of the tactics of Senators Lee, Cruz and Paul – that it is supposedly putting them in a tough spot.Several of the Republicans are using the Manchin-Toomey compromise plan as an excuse to cave on the gun filibuster. They claim that Senators Lee, Cruz, and Paul are running ahead of the conference in their insistence on a filibuster.What they fail to see is that the cloture vote is the vote to stop the gun legislation from passage.Several Republican Senators intend to vote against the filibuster, but then vote against the overall bill. This is too clever by half. The GOP does not control the Senate as the GOP is want to say every time they don't want to fight.Their only power to block a gun control bill is to unite and filibuster.Voting for cloture is voting for the gun control bill because, again, as the GOP reminds us, they are not in the majority. The only way to stop it is to filibuster.

How to Read Nancy is the best book ever written about comics. No question. Besides using a single 1959 Nancy strip to demonstrate all of the formal properties of the medium in an unprecedented fashion, Paul Karasik and Mark Newgarden manage to take that same comic and map a huge artistic / professional /industrial/ historical story about comics. This story includes: How a gag might have a history unto itself; how a teenage apprentice could become a giant of the medium; how the damn comics were actually printed; how arbitrarily they could be published; and casual-seeming dives into cartoonists-gone-Hollywood, particular studio building, and even a now-obscure New York paper. I don't think there's another book that covers all of those facets, all of which are integral to the comics of the 20th century and few of which have been told. And Karasik and Newgarden do it with concision and, of course, wit. It's truly inspired. On a personal note, Paul Karasik was the first cartoonist I interviewed for publication (Ganzfeld 1) and Mark Newgarden maybe the first cartoonist I visited in New York. I interviewed them by email, and they answered in a single voice. Please visit the book's website for more info and a list of upcoming events.

Looks like D/N80 makes very high quality goods. I say "looks" because I never received mine. I ordered 2 straps in 2 wks & throughout 6 wks I pinged for Order Ack/status. After 4 wks, D/N80 emailed & said that the pieces were cut & need to be assembled. I asked if I could change my color if possible on one. Two wks later he canceled both with no explanation. I suspect he canceled because I had asked for the "possibility to change"; & in no way insisted the change. I was expecting he either say "no, can't do"; "yes, but you have to wait longer", or "yes, no problem"... but instead just a cancellation 2 wks later. Every business owner has the "right to refuse service"; its just a bummer that the "right" came after 6 weeks of waiting. 100% refund provided.

"Made up your mind? Going to burn them all?" Xuan was looking at a document. Zheng said. "Yes, all of them. Fucking, there's already sniper rifles. We would be facing a modernized army if we don't kill them. I am curious what Imhotep is up to though." Xuan replied without raising his head. "70% chance he's already inside the pyramid. 20% chance he's watching us from nearby. 10% chance he went to Hamunaptra. Which one do you think is more beneficial for us?" Zheng answered without thinking. "Of course inside the pyramid. So we can take care of him on the way. Otherwise he might show up during the fight. What are you looking at?" Xuan raised his head. "Information about Egyptian mythologies I got from Evelyn. I am looking for ones that might be true. If this is an actual world, this shouldn't be the only treasure. Perhaps other treasures have similar quest items that can increase our strength." Zheng immediately said. "And the result?" "Give up on all of them." He adjusted his glasses and took a drink from a glass. "The cost to reward ratio is too low because we don't know if these mythologies are true. Second, there are expenses such as time, bullets, and expendable items. Third, they belong to plots that we are not familiar with. We don't know where the dangers will come from or how to use the quest items. Unless we have over 50% chance of success, I won't consider these mythologies." Zheng wanted to laugh but held it to himself. "Then why are you so focused on the document? Aren't they useless to you?" "I had Evelyn wrote them in both hieroglyphs and English. I am getting the structure of hieroglyphs and how to go about translating them. We need to let ourselves accept new knowledge under any situation." Zheng nodded. "Right, right. I understand. So how are we going to burn the forest? Aren't you worried about the wind?" Xuan grabbed a map looking paper. It was hand drawn. "I flew around while you were inside the forest and drew its terrain. It may not look like it but this forest is a triangle. We need to use incendiary bombs at these four places. Spread the bombs out the among 100 square feet in each place and detonate them with your grenades. It will be the most effective. We will be able to burn down the whole forest regardless of wind direction, unless God cause some accident." "It sounds easy but what kind of accident? I have a bad feeling about it." "Uh, killing too many pygmies and God evolves them into something else, like King Kong." Xuan suddenly laughed lightly. "So, this is a gamble. We are dead if we lose the bet. Because there might be other ways to enter the pyramid that don't require killing all the pygmies. There's a 30% chance we will die from God interfering." Zheng didn't thought much about King Kong but then he imagined a pygmy piloting a Gundam, especially his favorite Providence and shook his head. "Anyway, just try our best. Uh, you know how to laugh?" Xuan laughed and said. "Yes. Pull muscles upward. However, crying is more difficult. Even though I can do the expression, its difficult to stimulate tears. If there's available device, crying is also possible." Zheng tapped his shoulder then walked out of the tent. "Don't worry. You will reach the fourth stage. Comrade." "Comrade?" They finished setting up the incendiary bombs by evening with the help of the movie characters. Zheng used a simple detonation device Xuan created then detonated them. They looked down from the dirigible and saw the forest began burning at four locations. Black smoke rose up to the sky then the fire moved into the inner forest. "This is the basic situation. Judging by the size of this forest, it will take three to four days for the fire to reach the pyramid. Then three to four more days for the forest to cool down. Which means we need to wait eight days. How much time do you have left?" Zheng said. "Fifteen days. If we count eight days including today, we will have eight days left. It should be enough time to enter the pyramid and kill the Scorpion King." "Then the probability of my plan should be a bit higher. The reason God gave you sixty days might be to give you time to burn the forest and wait for it to cool." Ardeth sighed beside them. "It's unfortunate for this forest. If we could preserve it, then the whole Egypt…" He shook his head. Zheng tapped his shoulder and said. "Let it go. Even if we don't burn the forest, your tribe wouldn't be able to take care of the pygmies. Furthermore, the forest might disappear without the magic power from Anubis after we defeat the Scorpion King.

Guaranteed issue laws require insurance companies to issue a health plan to any applicant – an individual or a group – regardless of the applicant's health status or other factors. Currently, in most states, insurance companies can deny nongroup coverage to people based on their health status or their medical expenses over the past year. This means that an uninsured person who develops a certain condition, such as breast cancer, might not be able to buy health insurance. In such an instance, insurance companies can (and often do) refuse to issue a health insurance policy to that individual.

We know a new Fire TV interface is coming soon, but the big questions are which devices will receive the new interface, and what does it have to offer? Tucked at the bottom of Amazon's press release for the new Fire TV Stick 2 are partial answers to both of those questions. Amazon says the new interface "will be available for all Fire TV customers" through an over-the-air update. Later this year, the Fire TV Stick 2 and the Fire TV 2 will receive the update first, and the Fire TV Stick 1 and Fire TV 1 will follow.
Who are we? How did we get to be this way? These are two of the greatest questions facing our species.

Tools for Exterior Painting Posted on February 18, 2018 | By STEVE Have you ever thought of trying to tackle interior and exterior painting on your own? It's a big job, but when the price tag of a professional contractor seems just a bit outside your budget, you may be tempted to DIY your homes' paint job. However, before you rush off to the nearest hardware store, take a moment to learn about the most important tools you'll need to do a good job. Remember, having the right tools and materials helps to ensure that the job is done right and helps to protect your home. A poorly done job will just need to be redone sooner and may cost even more than your original contractor's estimate in necessary repairs! First you'll want a good five-in-one tool. It should be able to pull nails, scrap paint or spread putty, open your paint can, clean out cracks before caulking, squeeze paint out of rollers and all of that should be contained in a handle that is sturdy enough to use to pound shut the lids of paint cans. While there are seven-in-one tools and other tools with even more features than that, a five-in-one tool should be sufficient for a standard house painting job. Next is a good ladder. You'll want a ladder that you can use both inside and outside the house depending on which area you're going to be painting. There are many different types of convertible ladders and though they may be more expensive on the outset, in the end it's cheaper than buying two or three ladders to have in different places all around the house. Plus, if you have one ladder that can be used to reach all different heights then you only have to find space to store one ladder rather than two. Another necessary tool is drop cloths; you will need these whether you're painting inside your house and want to protect floors and furniture from drips, or outside your house where you'll want to protect grass and bushes. One of the most important steps in prepping the outside of your home to be painted is to pressure wash. This means that flecks of paint and debris can fall down on your grass, trees and plants and destroy them. Covering them with a cloth drop cloth allows the water to pass through but catches any debris from the house keeping your plants safe. Local interior painters If you don't have a pressure washer, it's a tool you may want to add it to your list of tools. If your house is built with wood siding, however, skip the pressure washer and instead go for a good quality spray nozzle for your garden hose; a power washer can damage wood. You'll also need a stiff bristle brush, putty knife and sander to help quickly strip and remove loose paint once the house has dried. Be warned, if your house was built before 1978 its original coat of paint may contain lead. If you think your house may have been painted with lead paint then it's best to give up the idea of a DIY paint job. The lead can leech through layers of paint and cause serious health problems.… Read More »

ALLAHABAD: The Allahabad high court on Monday issued notice to Uttar Pradesh minister Azam Khan on a petition filed by policemen belonging to the jat community who alleged they were transferred out of Muzaffarnagar after the recent communal clashes in that district upon his "orders".Justice Sudhir Agrawal also stayed the impugned transfers "provided they have not already joined at the transferred place" and that the authorities concerned shall, in the meantime, "ensure payment of their salary at Muzaffarnagar but it will be open to them to take work or not".The order was passed on the petition of Pankaj Kumar and six others, all of them constables or head constables, who were transferred to "far-off places like Chitrakoot, Basti, Banda, Hamirpur and Pratapgarh".The petitioners have alleged that following the riots, "police personnel of a particular community (jat)" were being shifted "from western part of UP to other places like eastern side or Bundelkhand" and that this was being done "following the directions/orders" issued by Khan, who has been named in the petition.Fixing October 10 as the next date of hearing in the matter, the court sought counter-affidavits from Khan as well as the state's chief standing counsel.The court also wanted an affidavit "filed by an officer of not below the rank of Deputy Inspector General of Police" stating the reasons for the aforesaid transfers.

Another week passes as we watch former fantasy greats fade into the sunset. Too dramatic? Maybe, but this year has been a slap in the face to many fantasy owners who expected big things from big stars, only to have said players scoff at the notion of elite performances. Drew Brees, Lesean McCoy, Calvin Johnson, Matt Forte, Doug Martin…the list goes on and on. While I understand some would argue Martin, the fact remains that he was a top 14 overall pick. Let's take a look at the top 10 drafted in my home league, the IFFL: LeSean McCoy, Adrian Peterson, Jamaal Charles, Matt Forte, Calvin Johnson, Peyton Manning, Marshawn Lynch, Eddie Lacy, Le'Veon Bell and Demaryius Thomas.

How to Get a Show on HBO
Amazon to bring 3,000 jobs to Florida in deal with state
Last week, NBC's Grimm had its first outing in its new timeslot and it saw an increase from its usual Friday numbers, but nothing too earth-shattering.  Its rating in the Tuesday 10 PM EST hour was at a 1.9 in the 18-49 demographic (down from the preliminary 2.0 that I reported on the  Cancellation Watch Twitter Site ) with 5.8 million total viewers.  Those are decent numbers for the fourth place network and Grimm actually beat Revolution last week (which sunk to a series low of a 1.8 rating).  But does NBC really gain anything by moving the show to that timeslot? The series has consistently performed well on Fridays, often ranking as the top scripted program in the 18-49 demo for the night.  The move to Tuesdays could potentially increase its numbers in the long run, but they are probably best off leaving the show on Friday and perhaps trying to use it as an anchor for a block of genre shows for that evening. Which takes us to Thursday night's Hannibal which has struggled with the Nielsens of late after starting off relatively well.  That show could only muster a 1.1 rating last week with 2.6 million total viewers, which was a slight improvement from the prior week but still cancellation level numbers.  NBC chose not to give Hannibal more of a chance by switching it to the Tuesday post- Voice slot where it could have found a bigger audience.  True, it's not particularly compatible with that singing/competition show, but then Grimm isn't really either.  Personally, I think that the network gave up on Hannibal before it began.  They gave it a very late season start (never a good sign) in a timeslot that has been certain death for one show after the other on that network over the last couple of years.  And the truth is that Hannibal really doesn't fit on the broadcast networks.  Its lurid and rather violent subject matter would appeal more to the audiences that tune in for shows like The Walking Dead and The American Horror Story , and I believe many of them steer clear of the broadcast networks knowing that they typically deliver watered down product.  Still, I have a gut feel that someone at NBC might be holding out a shred of hope for the show and may consider bringing it back next year and paring it up with Grimm on Fridays, which is what they should have done in the first place.  It's a slim chance, but I wouldn't completely rule it out.  That said, though, based strictly on the show's numbers I have raised its Cancellation Alert to Elevated. The Wednesday through Friday CW shows continue to fly low as the season winds down.  On Wednesday, Arrow delivered a 0.9 rating in the 18-49 demo with 2.9 million total viewers and Supernatural had the same rating with 2.1 million total viewers.  On Thursday, Vampire Diaries had a 1.0 rating with 2.2 million total viewers and Beauty and the Beast had a 0.5 rating with 1.2 million total viewers.  All four of those shows have been renewed for another season.  On Friday, Nikita only scraped up its usual 0.3 rating with 1.2 million total viewers, and we are still waiting to hear the fate of that show. On CBS on Thursday, Person of Interest was down from its season to date average again with a 2.4 rating and thirteen million total viewers.  On FOX on Friday, Touch pulled another 0.6 rating with 2.2 million total viewers.  The former series has been renewed and the latter will almost certainly be cancelled. There are only a few broadcast network shows that we don't know the renewal/cancellation status for, but all of that should be resolved by next week.  Starting Monday the 13th are the upfronts when the nets will announce their schedules for the coming season.  So we should know by then all of the returning shows and any new genre entries that will be added to the schedule.  Keep an eye on this site and the Cancellation Watch Twitter Site for breaking news over this and the coming week as the broadcast networks iron out their plans for the upcoming season. Below are the full numbers from last week and I covered the Sunday/Monday shows in my mid-week column .  Keep an eye on the Cancellation Watch Twitter Site for the early returns from Sunday thru Monday shows from this week.  You can see the Cancellation Alert status of all the shows currently airing plus the final results from prior seasons at my Cancellation Watch page.  And for questions on how the ratings work and my Cancellation Alert statuses, you can see the Cancellation Watch FAQ .

Late last year I went to a conference session on sexism in the workplace. About 25 of us, mostly young professional women, sat around in a circle and swapped demoralising anecdotes about how the pay gap, motherhood, sexual harassment and oppressive gender expectations had impacted our careers. In terms of narrating these experiences, we were all on pretty much the same page. There was furious agreement that women are subjected to sexism in the public sphere, and that this is harmful to individuals and to society as a whole. Fantastic, I thought. We're switched on, we know what's what, and we're here together to talk about what we can do to fix things.
The "Gilded Age" in America was a time of rapid economic growth, and those who achieved such wealth celebrated it like never before. It was during this era that the Adirondack Park became one of the favorite playgrounds for the rich and famous, and the origin of the American Vacation. In the second half of the 19th century, or "Gilded Age," the affluent population of New York City would "vacate" the hot and muggy city for the cooler weather at their luxurious camps in the Adirondacks and thus the "American Vacation" was born.
TV executives are always telling us no one sets out to make a bad show. Which, with the exception of those cheesy Syfy movies, is probably true.But when you see something like "Do No Harm" (Thursday, 9 p.m., NBC/Ch. 5), you've got to wonder. This show is so bad it almost seems it would have to be intentionally awful.Steven Pasquale ("Rescue Me") stars as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde ... er, uh, neurosurgeon Jason Cole and hedonistic Ian Price. From 8:25 a.m.-8:25 p.m., Jason is in control. And, through the use of experimental drugs, he's been able to keep Ian under wraps for the last few years.But the drugs aren't working any more. And Ian is unleashed on an unsuspecting world.Executive producer David Schulner insists that "Do No Harm" is a cross between "House" and "Dexter," but neither Jason nor Ian is anywhere near that interesting. Jason is a straight-laced good guy; Ian is fond of drugs and hookers; and when they start fighting with each other - leaving each other video messages, sabotaging each other's lives - it's not dramatic, it's ridiculous."Do No Harm" is hilariously bad. We're not supposed to be laughing, but it's impossible to keep a straight face when utterly awful dialogue is dropped on us. Like when one of Jason associates says, "I may be supplying experimental drugs to the chief of neurosurgery, but I still have standards."You've got to laugh. Or else you'll cry at the wasted effort in "Do No Harm."The lead character may have two personalities, but this is one big piece of you-know-what.

As day 2 of Sasquatch! began everybody, from fans to bands to tech, seemed to be adjusting to the swing of things. It was a little warmer, and there was no rain in sight. After walking through a camping area set up with afternoon beer pong and a car blasting "Same Love," I finally got in to find the first wave of bands well into their sets. Bear Mountain had already pulled in a huge crowd with their catchy, comfort-food electronic pop, and Rose Windows were just finishing a decent set, albeit to a much smaller crowd.

Both Sides Of The Plate
The Asus Eee Pad Transformer prime is a relatively new tablet on the market, mostly known for its ability to "transform" from tablet to netbook with a keyboard dock. It features 18hours of battery life, which is 8 more hours of fun than you get with an ipad. Also it has a quad core tegra, which certainly makes it the fastest tablet on the market. But Asus has received a lot of critic over the past few weeks mainly due to GPS issues and the fact that the bootloader is locked (aka no custom roms). Apparently the GPS issues are due to the fact that the antenna tries to receive signals through a metal plating, which is impossible. And even though the ipad for example is also covered in metal it has plastic openings for signals to pass through. There has been an update to fix this problem but since its a design flaw it can only be tweaked — not fixed by updates.

It's no great secret that the anti-vaccine movement is rife with scientific inaccuracies and logical fallacies, but a few of their claims are so extraordinarily erroneous and demonstrably false that I have difficulty calling them anything other lies. There are several of these falsehoods that I considered writing about, such as the blatantly false claim that vaccines contain mercury and aborted fetal cells, but I ultimately decided to focus on just two dangerous and pervasive assertions: the claim that the safety of vaccines hasn't been tested, and the claim that measles isn't a dangerous disease.

Litigation against police agencies for the use and misuse of control agents and procedures has become an important issue for the forensic medical specialist and expert witness. As police technology improves, it becomes apparent that more information for forensic experts will be required in this area. One such area of concern is the use of tear gas by police. This paper addresses the basic types of gas in terms of their chemistry, uses, and medical side effects and complications. Two types of gases--namely, chloroacetophenone (CN) and orthochlorobenzylidenemalontrile (CS)--are discussed in terms of basic properties, unique advantages, and possible harm to the body. CN and CS are relatively safe agents that can be used to control the behavior of a dangerous person. Clinical examples of their use and misuse by police are also reported. Specific guidelines are offered to help ensure a proper assessment of the dangerous person and to protect the health and lives of police personnel, perpetrators, and others exposed to the tear gas. Forensic experts called to testify about the behavior of the disturbed person or to assess the appropriateness of action taken to subdue that person must become more aware of the technology employed by police agencies to accomplish this particular job of protecting public safety.

There are numerous reasons why you should wear animal prints this summer. In today's post I am about to show you some of the best outfits featuring this wild print. You might ask: Why is it still so popular? The main reason is that animal print makes any outfit look fresh and trendy. It's no secret, the skin pattern of leopard, cheetah, zebra, tiger, crocodile, and snake make anyone look special. This phenomena makes any outfit style look daring, bold and sophisticated. Moreover, this bright pattern can make your outfit look classic, of course if the styling is done right. Keep in mind one thing, it's not always simple to dress in animal prints. That's why I made up this beautiful collection of various bloggers, editors and fashion addicts wearing animal print clothes in their everyday lives.

Are you afraid that, as you get older, you're falling short of your goals of being all of the above? There's a tendency for people to believe the old adage of the famous psychologist William James who asserted that personality is set in plaster by the age of 30. Or you might be lured into agreeing with the perspective that our personalities are through changing by the age of 5 (or perhaps 12). Either way, you might feel discouraged and hopeless about never being the kind of person you always imagined you could be.
The second-order azimuthal anisotropy Fourier harmonics, v 2 , are obtained in p − Pb and PbPb collisions over a wide pseudorapidity ( η ) range based on correlations among six or more charged particles. The p -Pb data, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 nb − 1 , were collected during the 2013 LHC p -Pb run at a nucleon-nucleon center-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV by the CMS experiment. A sample of semiperipheral PbPb collision data at s NN = 2.76 TeV , corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.5 μ b − 1 and covering a similar range of particle multiplicities as the p − Pb data, is also analyzed for comparison. The six- and eight-particle cumulant and the Lee-Yang zeros methods are used to extract the v 2 coefficients, extending previous studies of two- and four-particle correlations. For both the p − Pb and PbPb systems, the v 2 values obtained with correlations among more than four particles are consistent with previously published four-particle results. These data support the interpretation of a collective origin for the previously observed long-range (large Δ η ) correlations in both systems. The ratios of v 2 values corresponding to correlations including different numbers of particles are compared to theoretical predictions that assume a hydrodynamic behavior of a p − Pb system dominated by fluctuations in the positions of participant nucleons. These results provide new insights into the multiparticle dynamics of collision systems with a very small overlapping region.

Spiegel is reporting that it has seen "top secret NSA documents" that detail the NSA's ability to gather information from most smartphones, including iPhones, Android, and and BlackBerry phones. Though the article doesn't fully lay out the details, at the very least the NSA reportedly has scripts for gathering off of computers that — in the case of iOS — the phone has synced with. Though Spiegel uses the word "tap" repeatedly, it's unclear whether that means the NSA can actually access this data remotely — the ability to gather data from devices you have physical access to is relatively trivial, especially if that data isn't encrypted and only protected by a passcode.

Islamist hard-liners angry at the execution last month of the assassin of Punjab Gov. Salmaan Taseer have stepped up calls for Asia Bibi, a Catholic woman sentenced to die for blasphemy, to be put to death. Hundreds of supporters of the Islamist group Pakistan Sunni Tehreek staged rallies across Pakistan on April 16 calling for Bibi's execution and the deaths of other blasphemers. The rallies in Karachi, Rawalpindi, Lahore and other cities were organized by Sunni Tehreek head, Sarwat Ijaz Qadri, as part of the group's response to the execution of Mumtaz Qadri. Qadri, Taseer's bodyguard, shot the former governor for speaking out against the country's controversial blasphemy laws. Bibi, a Catholic mother of five, was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to death after being accused of insulting the Prophet Muhammad by a group of Muslim women who were angry Bibi drank from the same water container as them. If executed, Bibi would become the first woman in Pakistan to be executed for blasphemy. Pakistan's Supreme Court is due to hear an appeal by Bibi against her sentence. "We will protect the sanctity of Holy Prophet at every cost and will not sit idle if Asia Bibi Masih is freed," Pakistan Sunni Tehreek said in a statement read out at all rally sites. "The whole nation will take to the streets … if any blasphemer was sent abroad," the group warned. If Bibi wins her appeal it is expected she will be forced to go into exile. The group also said authorities had deliberately tried to weaken blasphemy laws by executing Mumtaz Qadri. "A conspiracy is being hatched. ... We will not let it happen. The rulers have begun a war with religious forces by hanging Mumtaz Qadri," the statement concluded.

Why this was done we may never know, but the result is that the two versions of Phantasy Star are as different as they are alike.

Interference with a Tuning Fork If you strike a tuning fork and rotate it next to your ear, you will note that the sound alternates between loud and soft as you rotate through the angles where the interference is constructive and destructive. It is challenging to visualize this in a diagram because of the large difference in scale between the tuning fork and the wavelengths of the sound produced. A tuning fork to produce equal tempered middle-C (C 4 , 261.6Hz) would have a dimension of a few centimeters, but the sound wavelength at room temperature would be about 1.3 m or over four feet. This is an attempt to qualitatively visualize the interference from a binary source using a photo of the interference pattern in a ripple tank with a double vibrator. That photo is superimposed on a sketch of a tuning fork in the hope that it might give some insight about the nature of interference in waves from a double source. But the scale here is profoundly different: the separation of the two ripple tank wave sources is several wavelengths, whereas the separation of the two tines of the C-tuning fork is maybe 1/50th of the wavelength. This pattern would suggest several minima of loudness, whereas the tuning fork gives four minima at 45° from the plane of the two tines when rotated. Animations of the interference patterns with single and multiple sources may be found at Dan Russell's site at Penn State. The pattern at right is from the animation of a lateral quadrupole source. This is the best approximation of the interference of the tuning fork since the two tines of the fork are out of phase, and Russell notes that two opposite phase dipoles make up a lateral quadrupole source. This diagram gets closer to what you experience by rotating the tuning fork by your ear, but the problem of scale is still present since the sound wavelength for the C tuning fork is fifty times the size of the physical vibrator. This diagram shows that Russell's lateral quadrupole gives equal intensities at 90°. But with the tuning fork, your ear tells you that the maxima in the plane of the two tines is significantly stronger than the maxima perpendicular to that plane. Each tine of the fork produces a pressure wave which travels outward at the speed of sound. One part of the wave has a pressure higher than atmospheric pressure, another lower. At some angles the high pressure areas of the two waves coincide and you hear a louder sound. At other angles, the high pressure part of one wave coincides with the low pressure part of the other.

BALLABGARH: Returning home to a village near Ballabgarh in Haryana, after shopping for Eid at Jama Masjid in Delhi, a family ran into a nightmare on a local train on Thursday evening. For three and a half hours, they were abused, humiliated and assaulted by a mob of 15-20 people that passed communal remarks and accused them of carrying beef in a bag.Finally, a 19-year-old was stabbed to death and another received stab injuries. The GRP at Ballabgarh railway station failed to intervene and stop the assault.The GRP claimed on Friday to have arrested a man and detained a suspect allegedly involved in the attack.Haryana DGP B S Sandhu, however, denied that the incident was the outcome of an argument over beef. "This was a clash between two groups which resulted in the death of one person. We have already arrested one of the accused. Police teams are investigating and others too will be arrested," he told TOI.The youths, from Khandoa village near Ballabgarh, had boarded an EMU at Sadar Bazar around 5.30pm. Junaid, the teenager killed by the mob, and his brothers — Mohsin, Haseem and Moeen — were carrying gifts and food for their family members and had packed them in plastic bags.Haseem (20) said that they had occupied two seats and were playing ludo when the train reached Okhla station. Around 15 to 20 people boarded the Mathura-bound train and asked them to vacate the seats. When they refused, the men abused them with communal remarks.They started calling us names and said we were unpatriotic and anti-nationals and then started hitting us. They were pointing at a packet which had food and saying that we should not be allowed to sit since we were carrying beef," said Haseem. They denied they were carrying beef and tried to reason with the men but they became even more aggressive.Moeen (17), Junaid's cousin, said they finally got up, somehow managed to free themselves from the mob and moved to the adjacent coach but the men followed them there, hurling abuses."We decided to get down at Faridabad station and take another train to Ballabgarh but the men blocked our way and asked the other passengers to prevent us from leaving," said Mohsin (18). "We pleaded with them to let us go but we were caught between two seats. And there was a crowd at the exit." Scared that they would be attacked again, Mohsin called their brother Shakir, asking him to reach the station with some help.When they tried again to get off at Ballabgarh, a heated argument ensued. Shakir had responded to their call and boarded the train. Some men in the mob now pulled out knives and attacked Junaid when he tried to force his way out. "He was pinned by four men and stabbed repeatedly till he fell unconscious.When Shakir and Moeen tried to intervene, the men caught Shakir and stabbed him in the throat, chest and hands," said Mohsin.He said since the train had started moving, they pulled the chain but it didn't work.Mohsin said everything was happening in plain sight of GRP personnel at Ballabgarh railway station but they refused to help them. "To save ourselves, we called the police and the emergency response number but there was no response," he said.The train reached Asavati station around 9pm where they were pushed out before the train left for Mathura. They were taken to the civil hospital at Palwal by family members who had hired an ambulance from a local hospital.Junaid was declared brought dead. Shakir was referred to AIIMS Trauma Centre where he is said to be critical. Mohseen and Moeen too were admitted to the civil hospital while Haseem was discharged after treatment.The SHO of GRP at Ballabgarh police station, Surat Pal, admitted that they couldn't rescue the four youths due to the crowd at the station. "One of them, Mohsin, called an ambulance when his brother was stabbed. Such things happen.Whenever there is a riot or fight, such things happen and people say some communal things but we can't do anything," said Pal quite nonchalantly. "The fight took place over seats. We are trying to identify the other accused."Union information and broadcasting minister M Venkaiah Naidu has condemned the incident. "No one should take the law into their own hands. Even if there was a rumour, no one has the right to do this. The agencies should look into it and see who are behind this," he said.

Like in August , I processed the downloaded Dotlan data for September 2015. Let's see the ratting charts first: Well, well, the fruits of years of continous neglecting of highsec are now obvious: there are less PvE activity in highsec than in nullsec. While nullsec ratting increased a bit it's not the reason for the change but quick decrease of highsec activity. And you know what correlates very well with highsec PvE activity. The most bizarre result of this change can be seen on Dotlan : Goons are now literally the biggest carebears of New Eden. While they are ratting more than ever, the main reason of the change is the serious decrease in highsec, as Deklein only increased by 0.9M: The most important is to see how quickly Providence returned to their high position in ratting. Let's see the alliances: Goons reached their record so far, due to Deklein being down on the CFC loss list (beaten by Vale and Pure Blind). Their ratting concentration is 4x higher than the Nullsec average, showing that CCP made a serious mistake listening to the Document of Shame , a joint venture of Nullsec overlords to remove conflict from Nullsec. With the increased anomaly count there is absolutely no reason to take the land of another group, there are enough anoms for 4x more nullsec people than current, not just as a theoretical possibility, but as an everyday practice. I'd suggest to decrease anom count in all systems to 1/4 of current. Soviet-Union continues its march up the chart, now being #3 ratter. The xxDeath renters are not only down but extremely underutilizig their space, just like B0T renters, but at least they are a bit up. Razor and CVA both returned to pre-war ratting while xxDeath proper decreased their activity. September was record for the Imperium in absolute numbers, but as it was huge for whole nullsec, their percentage record is still May. These are obviously not the numbers I want to see but since CCP completely removed conflict from nullsec, we can't hope that any other Sov owner will fight them (see how Providence attempted no retaliation for the earlier Imperium attacks). We must wait (and send support) until MoA grows to the point where they alone can make ratting impossible in Deklein.

I know I've said it before (though I can't remember where) but one of the deficiencies of the general anti-capitalist left, a population to which I belong, is its inability to think dialectically.  Even more of a problem is that, amongst marxists, this inability to think dialectically is often disguised as "dialectical"––so much so that there is a long history of one marxist group or individual calling another marxist group or individual "undialectical" for reasons that have nothing to do with dialectical logic.  And the semi-popular tendency of leftish academics calling every set of relational terms "dialectical" tends to produce all manner of confusion. In an old post, On Dialectical Materialism , I attempted to provide a simple primer, short and to the point, of what it meant to use dialectical logic as a historical materialist.  And while it may indeed be a fact that "dialectical materialism", which has a curious history of being short-handed as "diamat", is a term that was not used by Marx or Engels––prompting some of my readers to complain, at the time that piece was written, that I was using "Stalinist" terminology––this is simply a semantic problem.  Marx and Engels spoke of doing dialectics as materialists, other writers outside of the "Stalinist" tradition (including Trotsky) used the term "materialist dialectics" and so I see no problem to relinquish the most popularized term of Marx and Engels' philosophical method.  Whatever the case, semantic quibbles aside, the main reason I wrote that piece is due to what I saw as a deficiency in some marxist critiques, as well as anti-capitalist critiques in general, of the current conjuncture.  The implicit argument hidden behind my summary of dialectical materialism was that the absence of dialectical thinking amongst broad sectors of the left demonstrated a deficiency in thought.  The fact that some marxists were wont to use the name  of "dialectics" without any apparent fidelity to the concept  was perfect proof of this deficiency: the logical tools behind the science of historical materialism were either being abandoned or misused.

A cricketer whose Test career did not compare to his impressive domestic record, Parthasarthi Sharma was a well-built, right-hand batsman. Selected in the national team following a series of impressive performances for Rajasthan and Central Zone in the Ranji and Duleep Trophies, Sharma had a promising beginning, scoring 54 and 49 on debut against West Indies in Delhi in 1974-75. A less successful outing in the next Test, in which he scored 6 and 9, had him axed. On tours to New Zealand and West Indies, Sharma opened with Sunil Gavaskar in the first Test in Bridgetown, but scored only 6 and 1. At home against England in 1976-77, he had scores of 4, 29, 9 and 20 in two Tests and was discarded for good after defeats in both games.

My name is Ben Davis-Hayden, son-in-law to the late Jack Adrian Dickerson, Jr. Jack passed away unexpectedly on June 4, 2015, due to complications with his kidneys. He had no life insurance for the family to fall back on in this circumstance, and we have next to nothing by way of extra money to cremate him. His wife, Darla, has called around to various funeral homes in the area, and has been told the cremation would cost anywhere from $700 to $1500. We're trying our best to gather some sort of funding, but we don't stand a chance on our own. Any amount given will help immensely, and will be greatly appreciated.

It's hard to understand the pain that comes with trying to get pregnant and it not working. Or trying to get pregnant, only to get the positive test and lose the baby before you got too far into it. Infertility sucks. Plain and simple and when you're struggling with infertility, one of the most challenging aspects is dealing with other women's pregnancy. It's incredibly hard when a close friend or family member becomes pregnant, especially if it wasn't hard for her to conceive, and then to have to worry about why life isn't fair because you're still waiting, fighting, and hurting.

From Zestaponi to Chiatura one needs about an hour by marshrutka. The town is located in a mountain valley on the banks of the Qvirila River. Because of its unusual location, crammed in the valley, the manganese mines are situated on the surrounding hills, the main transport is the ropeway. In the past there were several dozens ropeways, still most of them go as before – in its original unaltered condition.

Although conservative Democrats are elected all over the United States, most come from Southern states and have been previously known as "Dixiecrats" or "Boll Weevils."

For example, the term "boll weevils" was frequently applied to conservative Democrats in the 1980s who consistently voted in favor of then Present Ronald Reagan 's increase of military spending, tax cuts and deregulation of the financial system.

It works as advertised. Being able to keep the factory amps and chimes is a plus. All I did was matched the wires up to the radio and worked like a charm. You can also adjust the output so that the radio signal matches the Bose amp. The only issue I have was the unit itself is kinda bulky and had to squeeze everything into a tight place in my Cadillac Deville. If you are like me and wanting to get rid of the factory radio this is your best solution.

Many vegans are of the opinion that when it comes to non-dairy vegan cream cheeses, there's really only one contender: Tofutti brand, and the hydrogenated one at that. True, hydrogenated oils are not good for you, but the taste difference between the Tofutti regular cream cheese and the non-hydrogenated version is vast. Save the non-hydrogenated version for your everyday uses, and splurge on the blue tub for a recipe such as this one, which is meant to be sweet, delicious and the perfect topping to your vegan cake.

Promotion for fragrances don't have to involve much to be suggestive and to stir the imagination.

Behold a photo shot by Peter Lindberg for Guerlain's classic masculine fragrance Habit Rouge, genre: (tres) masculin . [translation: Gender: (very) masculine].

Margaret Thatcher's decision to open up London's financial marketplace to international banks in 1986 revolutionised the purpose of London. Rather than being the capital of Great Britain and the United Kingdom it was to become the global hub for international capital. Not only were the markets opened up to international banks, the international rich were invited into London, to take residence and buy up the housing from the indigenous Londoners. Thatcher wanted to hollow out London, and show the indigenous population out of the city, to make for the international rich.
In the third trimester of pregnancy, the human fetus has the capacity to process perceptual information []. With advances in 4D ultrasound technology, detailed assessment of fetal behavior [] is now possible. Furthermore, modeling of intrauterine conditions has indicated a substantially greater luminance within the uterus than previously thought []. Consequently, light conveying perceptual content could be projected through the uterine wall and perceived by the fetus, dependent on how light interfaces with maternal tissue. We do know that human infants at birth show a preference to engage with a top-heavy, face-like stimulus when contrasted with all other forms of stimuli []. However, the viability of performing such an experiment based on visual stimuli projected through the uterine wall with fetal participants is not currently known. We examined fetal head turns to visually presented upright and inverted face-like stimuli. Here we show that the fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy is more likely to engage with upright configural stimuli when contrasted to inverted visual stimuli, in a manner similar to results with newborn participants. The current study suggests that postnatal experience is not required for this preference. In addition, we describe a new method whereby it is possible to deliver specific visual stimuli to the fetus. This new technique provides an important new pathway for the assessment of prenatal visual perceptual capacities.
A spoof of typical 1980's teen movies. The idea is that VH1 found a "long-lost", never-released teen film made in the 1980's and decided to air it now in 2006; thus it is loaded with the typical formula, clichés, bad fashions, and stereotypical characters found in those movies and makes fun of them.

She did promise to investigate it, though. During the hearing, Congresswoman Diana DeGette held up one of the defective switches, and pointed out that it could have been fixed for 57 cents per car.

To compare the effects of three 7-week interval training programs varying in work period duration but matched for effort in trained recreational cyclists. Thirty-five cyclists (29 male, 6 female, VO(2peak) 52 ± 6 mL kg/min) were randomized to four training groups with equivalent training the previous 2 months (∼6 h/wk, ∼1.5 int. session/wk). Low only (n=8) trained 4-6 sessions/wk at a low-intensity. Three groups (n=9 each) trained 2 sessions/wk × 7 wk: 4 × 4 min, 4 × 8 min, or 4 × 16 min, plus 2-3 weekly low-intensity bouts. Interval sessions were prescribed at the maximal tolerable intensity. Interval training was performed at 88 ± 2, 90 ± 2, and 94 ± 2% of HR(peak) and 4.9, 9.6, and 13.2 mmol/L blood lactate in 4 × 16, 4 × 8, and 4 × 4 min groups, respectively (both P<0.001). 4 × 8 min training induced greater overall gains in VO(2) peak, power@VO(2) peak, and power@4 mM bLa- (Mean ± 95%CI): 11.4 (8.0-14.9), vs 4.2 (0.4-8.0), 5.6 (2.1-9.1), and 5.5% (2.0-9.0) in Low, 4 × 16, and 4 × 4 min groups, respectively (P<0.02 for 4 × 8 min vs all other groups). Interval training intensity and accumulated duration interact to influence the adaptive response. Accumulating 32 min of work at 90% HR max induces greater adaptive gains than accumulating 16 min of work at ∼95% HR max despite lower RPE.

Doxorubicin is a chemotherapeutic agent successfully used in the treatment of a wide range of cancers. However, with cumulative doses, doxorubicin also is known to have cardiotoxic effects, including cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Identification and quantification of myocardial cell damage has been a point of Controversy. We sought to identify these changes by measuring the levels of troponin I both 24 and 48 hr after the administration of doxorubicin as part of an antineoplastic treatment regimen. Thirty-eight patients scheduled to undergo treatment with doxorubicin were screened and approached for enrollment in the study. Thirty-one of them fulfilled all the inclusion criteria and also signed informed consent. All the patients enrolled in the study had blood drawn before the administration of doxorubicin and also 24 and 48 hr later. Electrocardiograms were performed prior to and 48 hr following the administration of chemotherapy. The dose of doxorubicin administered was calculated by the oncologist and ranged from 450 mg/m2-650 mg/m2 (mean 520 mg/m2). Only one patient was found to have en elevation of troponin levels both 24 and 48 hr (2.3 ng/mL and 2.1 ng/mL, respectively) after the administration of the drug. During that time, the patient denied any chest pain, shortness of breath or palpitations. Repeat ECG did not show any changes from the baseline. The remaining participants continued to maintain a troponin level of less than 0.3 ng/mL during the follow-up. In these patients, no electrocardiographic changes were noted in the follow-up ECG compared to the baseline; however, a slight drop in the ejection fraction without any impact on the clinical presentation was recorded. We concluded that the cTnl level does not change after the administration of doxorubicin, and thus cannot be used as a predictor of doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.
Finally, an update to the very outdated mod_blog that's been available since September 3, 2009. There still isn't much documentation because, as of yet. I doubt what's here is enough but for the most dedicated to go through the code to see how this works. REQUIREMENTS If you don't meet these requirements, then you probably won't get very far. The software was written in C (don't bother asking for Perl code---there isn't any, and there won't be any) and as such, makes certain assumptions, such as: * Linux (or any POSIX compilant UNIX system) * GCC (or any C99 compiler that may come with your system) * Apache * Lua 5.1 or higher The code right now assumes you'll be running this under Apache. COMPILATION You'll need to install my CGILIB library (6.6 or higher) to compile this blog software. You can install it from https://github.com/spc476/CGILib To install it once it's downloaded, all it should take is "make" and then "make install" as root. The library assumes a POSIX environment and should compile as is on most modern Unix systems. Once that is installed, you should be able to do a "make" and generate the blog engine. It's built as a setuid program to avoid having a world-writable directory, but if that is a concern, you can certain remove the setuid'ness of it, but make sure the data directories are writable by Apache. INSTALLATION The assumption on the blog engine is that the executable resides in a directory visible to Apache and runnable from within Apache's docroot for the the site in question. I have my copy named as "boston.cgi" and Apache configured to execute such programs via CGI. The htdocs/ subdirectory contains a sample website to run the blog. There's also a sample htaccess file that shows the method I use to run the blog engine. In the journal/ subdirectory is out-of-band files (which should not be served up by Apache). There you will find a sample configuration file and a sample entry to see how the data is stored (each entry is a separate file, stored under a Year/Month/Day directory structure). And yes, there is code to do email notifications, but it's not enabled by default. I only left the code in to support the half dozen people that did sign up to receive email notifications. The HTML entry form works, but it's not my primary method for new entries---for that, I use email. I have the following line in '/etc/aliases': myjournal: "/path/to/boston.cgi --config /path/to/config --email --cmd new" To make an entry, I format an email to the journal address as: +-----[top of file]---------------------------- |author: [who you set at author---exact match] |title: [title of entry] |class: [keywords] |status: [status repeated on Facebook] |adtag: [keyword used for advertising network] | |body of entry, usually including HTML | ... +---------------------------------------------- And that's pretty much it. Good luck.

After engaging in dialogue with USA Cycling to address the immediate concerns raised by the enforcement of UCI rule 1.2.019, the UCI issued the following statement today:"Notwithstanding the fact that rule 1.2.019 has been enforced in Europe for many years, it is clear strict enforcement in the U.S. and other countries will have unintended and undesirable consequences," said Steve Johnson, USA Cycling President & CEO. "USA Cycling listened to the views expressed by the cycling community in America, and these issues were fully represented in discussions with the UCI. We would like to thank the UCI for its willingness to suspend enforcement of the rule globally to allow time for productive dialogue with all stakeholders to find a workable solution for the future."

The miniseries adaptation of The Man In The High Castle was originally announced as a project back in 2010. At the time, the four-parter based on Philip K Dick's novel, was to be a Headline Pictures/Electric Shepherd/Scott Free production for the BBC, scripted by British playwright Howard Brenton and sold internationally by FremantleMedia. Some of the puzzle pieces have since shifted. Syfy said today it has sealed a deal to adapt the Hugo Award-winning tome with Frank Spotnitz (The X-Files, Hunted) attached to write and exec produce. Ridley Scott's Scott Free will produce with Headline, Electric Shepherd Productions (the production arm of Dick's estate) and FremantleMedia International. Producers are Ridley Scott and Stewart Mackinnon. Spotnitz will write the first two hours and supervise the writing of the second two hours, Syfy said today.

Entrapment is a defense to criminal charges. It prohibits a conviction when the defendant can show that he had no original intent to commit a crime, and did so only because law enforcement agents persuaded or coerced him. Law enforcement can provide opportunities for suspected criminals to commit crimes (through undercover operations or stings, for example) and then charge the offender, but police cannot "manufacture crime."

Disney-owned Maker Studios dropped Swedish YouTube star Felix Kjellberg aka PewDiePie from its roster Monday after he published videos with anti-semitic jokes. The separation was first reported by the Wall Street Journal Monday evening, and has since been confirmed by Maker, with a spokesperson sending Variety the following statement:
Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island, New York holds an annual "Visitor's Day" for families and area residents. William Higinbotham, looking for a way to entertain visitors, conceived of a simple electronic game that could be played using the lab's Donner Model 30 analog computer connected to an oscilloscope display. Working with David Potter, Higinbotham's creation allowed two players to play a game of 'tennis' on the oscilloscope screen, with simple physics for the ball, and even a sound whenever the ball was contacted.

When approaching a band's debut album, one should of course bear in mind the sage advice of George Michael and Listen Without Prejudice. Nevertheless the very facts of the making of Atoms for Peace's Amok seem designed to send a certain kind of music fan screaming from the room without hearing a note. It is, by any definition, the work of a supergroup: as well as Thom Yorke and long-term producer Nigel Godrich, it features Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, "guest percussionist" Mauro Refosco and REM's Joey Waronker. Amok resulted from their gathering together to indulge in "freeform" sessions in Los Angeles, having apparently bonded over a shared love of "getting wasted … and listening to Fela Kuti". Rich and famous musicians jamming in LA after getting high and kicking back with some funky ethnic sounds: it's hard to get away from the feeling that this is just the kind of thing that once provoked people to form the Cockney Rejects in protest. It is, to borrow a phrase sighingly deployed in Smash Hits with some regularity, like punk never 'appened.
State labor law exempts federal, state or municipal employees from minimum wage requirements, but Mr. Cuomo's office said he would act on his own through his Division of Budget, directing the initial wage increases taking effect at the end of year. He would also seek to change the labor law in the coming legislative session, which begins in January, to prevent future governors from using executive powers to roll back the wages. Mr. Cuomo will be up for re-election in 2018, at the end of which the $15 rate will be put into effect in New York City.
A new app is sparking a hot debate across campus colleges. Sasie is a sexual consent app which requires potential partners to read a contract, take a photo and sign before engaging in any intimate activity.Creators say it creates a legal, binding document of consent and intent. It was put together specifically for college campuses to combat what they say is the problem of sexual assault on campus.However, there are many issues with apps such as Sasie.One concern is if someone changes their mind after signing the contract. Some say it could essentially give potential rapist evidence they need to later exonerate themselves.Also, some are questioning if the couple would even stop to read the contract.Creators say it is legally binding but there is no test case yet. Once uploaded, the information goes to a server that only police, a disciplinary board or a subpoena can access.
Multisubunit RNA polymerases IV and V (Pol IV and Pol V) evolved as specialized forms of Pol II that mediate RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and transcriptional silencing of transposons, viruses, and endogenous repeats in plants. Among the subunits common to Arabidopsis thaliana Pols II, IV, and V are 93% identical alternative ninth subunits, NRP(B/D/E)9a and NRP(B/D/E)9b. The 9a and 9b subunit variants are incompletely redundant with respect to Pol II; whereas double mutants are embryo lethal, single mutants are viable, yet phenotypically distinct. Likewise, 9a or 9b can associate with Pols IV or V but RNA-directed DNA methylation is impaired only in 9b mutants. Based on genetic and molecular tests, we attribute the defect in RdDM to impaired Pol V function. Collectively, our results reveal a role for the ninth subunit in RNA silencing and demonstrate that subunit diversity generates functionally distinct subtypes of RNA polymerases II and V.

Side effects of combined oral contraceptives are the most common reason why women discontinue them. Over the past half century, an elaborate mythology about these ill effects has evolved, fueled by rumor, gossip and poor-quality research. In contrast, placebo-controlled randomized trials document that nonspecific side effects are not significantly more common with combined oral contraceptives than with inert pills. These reported nonspecific side effects may reflect the nocebo phenomenon (the inverse of a placebo): if women are told to expect noxious side effects, these complaints occur because of the power of suggestion. Alternatively, nonspecific complaints may simply reflect their background prevalence in the population. Because Level I evidence documents no important increase in nonspecific side effects with oral contraceptives, counseling about these side effects or including them in package labeling is unwarranted and probably unethical. When in doubt, clinicians should err on the side of optimism.

"Just because the Philippines or Vietnam are not as large as China doesn't mean that they can just be elbowed aside," said the US president. China's response? In effect, "yes we can". And that has become clear in the last few days. Aerial photography shows that China is using land reclamation to expand two islands in the Paracel Islands chain and to build or expand seven others in the Spratly group. Both island groups are in the South China Sea where China has drawn a so-called "nine dash line" that lolls like a great tongue dipping down and across the sea. Beijing's claims clash with those of the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei. "The bottom line", says Alan Dupont, a professor of international security at NSW University, "is that China is terraforming its way to control of the South China Sea by creating artificial islands and then militarising them." Dupont says "it's pretty clear-cut" that Beijing is seeking to "control the South China Sea and the eastern approaches to the Malacca Straits, which is the key choke point for global shipping given that 50 per cent of global trade goes through there."

Since the inauguration of Donald Trump as president of the United States, George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four has shot up the bestseller charts. The book's chilling account of a couple's struggle against a dystopian society has many elements that will strike a contemporary reader as disturbingly prescient. Orwell's description of "doublespeak" – the ability, and requirement, to utterly believe two contradictory thoughts at the same time – feels tailor-made for a president who simultaneously believes that three to five million "illegals" voted in the election, and that his victory in that election was completely fair and valid.

Description: Housing equipment with side to side airflow creates many challenges for IT and facility managers, particularly in regards to cooling. Because most enclosures are designed for a front to back airflow pattern, it is difficult to maintain ideal operating temperatures on side to side airflow equipment. The Rack Side Air Distribution Unit is a 2U rack mountable air distribution product for networking equipment or servers with side to side airflow. It pulls in conditioned air from the front of the rack and distributes it to the side air intake of the networking equipment.
Bullshit. The KKK and other idiot racists have every right to believe what they believe, spread it in literature and on the internet, on dumb podcasts and a variety of other mediums. But let's get one thing straight; the KKK, neo-Nazis and other loudmouth malcontents are violent people . They have a very long and sordid history of targeting minorities with their hate and too, too often does that hate transfer to murderous violence. By their own admission, these shit-for-brains use their rallies and marches to intimidate their victims. A racist march doubles as a recruiting tool and a statement; "minorities of this community, we are here, we hate you and we want you gone". You can find interviews with ex-members who will tell you flat out, this is the point. These marches are an intimidation tactic.
On April 30th, North Korea tried and found guilty US citizen Kenneth Bae for "hostile acts" against the state, sentencing him to 15 years of hard labor. A May 15th press release from North Korea's Korean Central News Agency stated that he has now begun serving his sentence within a "special prison." Bae, a devout Christian, is the owner of a North Korea tour company and was in the country with official permission when detained by North Korean authorities on November 3rd. What actually took place leading to his arrest has been the subject of much conjecture, but one thing is certain: Bae, a humanitarian who had compassion for North Korea's starving and abandoned orphans, is not indictable for any crime. Rather, he is a hostage being held to accommodate yet undetermined North Korean agenda.

Only a small percentage of the Cuban population currently has access to the internet, but that may be starting to change. According to the Union of Journalists of Cuba, the state-run telecom provider ETECSA plans to begin offering Wi-Fi service in Santiago de Cuba — the country's second largest city. That'll make accessing the internet somewhat easier for its residents, who typically have to use computers and connections at schools, offices, or government facilities. The fact that Wi-Fi will allow residents to connect phones and tablets should also be a big help, as those devices can be far less expensive than a traditional computer.

As described in the previous three posts, evolution wired humans to be moral, to form supernatural beliefs, and to sustain those beliefs. Yet, we are not genetically predisposed to believe Jesus is the son of God or Muhammad spoke to the angel Gabriel. In other words, religious traditions are a product of cultural evolution, not biological evolution. As societies went from tribal to modern, and as cultures interacted with one another, supernatural beliefs and religious traditions morphed to better suit the needs of their host civilizations. As time went on, only the most useful religions were left standing.

You may be surprised to learn that vitamin D is completely different from most other vitamins. It is actually a hormone, a steroid hormone that is produced out of cholesterol when your skin is exposed to the sun. For this reason, vitamin D is often referred to as the "sunshine" vitamin. However, sun exposure is often inadequate these days, making it necessary for people to get more of it from the diet (or supplements). This is important, because vitamin D is absolutely essential for optimal health (1). Unfortunately, only a handful of foods contain significant amounts of this vitamin, and deficiency is extremely common (2, 3). In fact, according to data from 2005-2006, a whopping 41.6% of the US population is deficient in this critical vitamin/hormone (4). This article explains everything you need to know about vitamin D.
"We are going to put the accelerator down on Snowy Hydro's development," the Prime Minister declared. "This is a great project and as it is expanded, it will ensure that Australian families and Australian businesses have more reliable power." And yet, Snowy 2.0 may just be the first step. If it proves viable – and that's a big "if" – behind closed doors there's talk of Snowy 3.0, Snowy 4.0 and Snowy 5.0, quadrupling the output to around 8000 megawatts, making it the largest power-grid battery in the world, dwarfing exisitng schemes in the US and China. "The more we head down towards decarbonising the economy, the more pumped hydro and hydro in general, the more important they will become in the whole energy market," Snowy Hydro chief executive officer Paul Broad says. But not everyone is a convert. Danny Price, managing director of Frontier Economics and an energy sector veteran, is scathing. "Pumped hydro makes no economic sense. It will never be built," he says bluntly. The Snowy Hydro Tumut 3 power station in Talbingo. Photo: Alex Ellinghausen

Raintree's maca is organically cultivated in the Andes Mountains in Peru. The central growing region for maca is in the Junin district of Peru. The best overland route is from Lima (310 km) up the Central Highway, crossing over the Andes through the high mountain pass of Anticona (Ticlio) which sits at 16,000 feet in elevation. It takes around five and one-half hours by car on this 2 lane highway that winds its way up the Andes and back down. The drive is quite scenic and the colors of the soils and mountain rocks quite dramatic and varied.

On the last day of school, right on Senior Prank Day in Roosevelt High, things don't look good for meek English teacher Andy Campbell, who feels exceptionally expendable facing a bleak future in front of severe job cuts, just before the year's new school season. But soon, things will go from bad to worse when feeble Campbell will infuriate the scary hot-headed history teacher Ron Strickland, who in turn, he will challenge him in an old-school, no-holds-barred, mano-a-mano throwdown in front of everybody, in the parking lot after school. Inevitably, now that the fight is on, no excuses, no regrets, and certainly no talking sense into Strickland, is going to save Campbell who needs to face the consequences of his actions and pay the heavy price.

It is apparent in the history of most art forms that there is an illicit attraction at the heart of fatality which, at times, renders the artist nearly deaf to other subjects. Themes of death, the void, and general absence emerge in different ways in literature and poetry–and not always through the words themselves, but in the negative spaces those words attempt to delineate. Charles Baudelaire, Stéphane Mallarmé and Maurice Blanchot are three writers who, in their accelerating gravitation towards these themes, found themselves approaching them from angles now thought to be revolutionary or uniquely poignant. Baudelaire's insistent wallowing in his own misery draped a heavy cloud of his desire for nothingness and absence over many of his poems, effectively producing a repetitious but intoxicating thematic consistency. And while Baudelaire's work enacted the ambiance of death weighing down upon him in the content of his work, Mallarmé arguably created a more revolutionary way of pleading with his obsessions through the form of his magnum opus "Un Coup de Dés", which plays with absence and the void physically through the empty space on the page itself. Blanchot takes a more direct philosophical approach to his own infatuation with death, comparing distinct perspectives on suicide, art and the nature of death in his essay "Death as Possibility". While all three writers had a consuming preoccupation with death and exhibited it in different ways, they all had a method of illuminating death and absence not always by addressing it directly, but by way of averted vision: mapping the boundaries of it with their language in order to inhabit a liminality that offered them a heightened state of wakefulness to both death and life.

Marriage is an abstract concept that, frankly, most young children don't fully understand. For them, it's usually good enough to know that when grown-ups love each other very much and want to be a family together, they get often get married. There's no need to discuss the tax implications or workplace benefits or hospital visitation rights with a three-year-old. But is it necessary to limit the concept to the traditional one-man-one-woman definition just because you're talking to a three-year-old? Even if you, personally, are okay with the idea of same-sex marriage? Even if you live in a country where same-sex marriage is legal? Lisa van de Geyn, writing in Today's Parent, seems to think so, because talking about same-sex marriage is hard.

In this comedy from Austin Powers director Jay Roach, Ben Stiller plays a young man who endures a disastrous weekend at the home of his girlfriend's parents. Greg Focker (Stiller) is completely in love with Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo), and views their upcoming trip to her parents' house on Long Island (where her sister is to be married during the weekend) as a perfect opportunity to ask her to marry him. Once Greg is introduced to Pam's parents, however, things stampede steadily downhill. Pam's father, Jack (Robert De Niro), takes an instant and obvious dislike to his daughter's boyfriend, lambasting him for his job as a nurse and generally making Greg painfully aware of the differences between him and Pam's family. Where Greg is grubby, relatively unambitious, and Jewish, Pam comes from a long line of well-mannered, blue-blooded WASPs. Things go from bad to worse in less time than it takes to spin a dreidel, with Greg incurring the wrath of both Pam's father -- who, it turns out, worked for the CIA for 34 years -- and the rest of her family, and almost single-handedly destroying their house and the wedding in the process. ~ Rebecca Flint Marx, Rovi

In Venezuela, there was a brief, bright moment when Edward Snowden, the N.S.A. leaker, was expected to land suddenly at Simón Bolívar International Airport, jet-lagged and red-eyed but safe and sound and victorious. His slipping out of Moscow and crossing the world would have been seen as a remarkable act of defiance against the power of the American government. Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro had offered him asylum after visiting Russia for the Gas Exporting Countries Forum, at the beginning of July. He declared that Snowden had done nothing wrong and was being subjected to a "crazy manhunt" by the United States authorities, and promised to protect him once he arrived in Caracas. It is probably no accident that Maduro made the announcement on July 5th, Venezuela's independence day.

Most of us scratch our heads when we hear about an incidence of someone being found innocent, despite being convicted of a crime by a jury. We think, "How could the jury have gotten it so wrong?"
Planning Commission on Monday further reduced the poverty line to Rs 28.65 per capita daily consumption in cities and Rs 22.42 in rural areas, scaling down India's poverty ratio to 29.8 per cent in 2009-10, the estimates which are likely to raise the hackles of civil society.An individual above a monthly consumption of Rs 859.6 in urban and Rs 672.8 in rural areas is not considered poor, as per the controversial formula.Furthermore, the Plan panel has kept the poverty threshold even lower than it submitted to the Supreme Court last year, which created an outcry among the civil society.The Plan panel had said in its affidavit before the apex court that the "poverty line at June 2011 price level can be placed provisionally at Rs 965 (32 per day) per capita per month in urban areas and Rs 781 (26 per day) in rural areas".The civil society had questioned this definition stating it was very low.As per estimates released today, the number of poor in India has declined to 34.47 crore in 2009-10 from 40.72 crore in 2004-05 estimated on the basis of controversial Tendulkar Committee methodology.The methodology recommended by the Committee includes spending on health and education, besides the calorie intake.Among religious groups, Sikhs have lowest poverty ratio in rural areas at 11.9 per cent, whereas in urban areas, Christians have the lowest proportion of poor at 12.9 per cent. Poverty ratio is the highest for Muslims, at 33.9 per cent, in urban areas. Further, poverty in rural areas declined at a faster pace than in urban cities between 2004-05 and 2009-10.
Since the day it was announced that Loretta Fuddy, the Director of the Hawaii Department of Health who verified Obama's birth certificate died mysteriously in a plane crash, there was some question of whether is was really an "accident". The authorities seem to be saying, yes. But, because of her close ties to the fraudulent Obama Birth Certificate, many people fear that she was the most recent in Obama's "dead pool" and haven't stopped looking for real answers. It seems that amateur bloggers and Youtubers are the new Investigative Journalists in this new media society of "give the President a pass, or be a racist".

After President Bill Clinton signed welfare reform legislation in 1996 "ending welfare as we know it," many highlighted this "common sense" solution and criticized progressives for opposing the bill.

But troubling reports soon emerged.

A beard-second is a measurement of length based on the distance that a beard hair grows in one second of time. This is similar, in structure though not in quantitative value, to a light-year, which is a measurement of length equal to the distance that light travels in one year. While a light-year is a very long distance, due to the tremendous speed of light, the beard-second is quite small since hair grows at a very slow rate. The exact length that this equals is the basis for some debate, and some sources cite it at about 10 nanometers (nm) while other sources use only 5 nm.

It seems Intel is looking to get into the content distribution game: The Wall Street Journal is reporting that the chip-making giant is planning to launch an Intel-branded, web-based TV service, complete with an Intel-built set-top box. Intel has apparently been making pitches to media companies for months, with plans to have similar TV channel offerings as existing cable and satellite TV providers, except all of the content would be delivered over the internet. Customers, however, would need to provide their own internet connection to access this service. The company is shooting to have this service launched by the end of the year, although it isn't yet clear if Intel will be able to meet that goal — The Wall Street Journal's source indicated that no content deals had been struck yet. Between this potential new service, the ever-present Apple TV set rumors, and proposed online TV network Ora.tv trying to lure Larry King out of retirement, it looks like internet-based TV could start really start putting pressure on cable providers.

There's a part of me that has always longed to lead a simpler, more ascetic life. But I've had to balance that with the demands of constantly being in the public eye. When I retired from coaching, Jeanie urged me to stay up to date with what was happening in the basketball world — which I did — but my first inclination was to go inside and become more attuned to my "inner minister." I fantasized about slowing down, living more mindfully, and dedicating myself primarily to service. I was happy being the chief cook and bottle washer at home and spending a good part of my time buying the groceries, making dinner, and taking care of the household. I taught meditation to some business executives and flirted with the idea of mentoring students at the Union Theological Center. As long as they didn't call me "Reverend," I thought, it would be OK.

When Roose freed Jaime, Jaime said jokingly, Give my regards to Robb Stark. It was him just running his mouth, it didn't really mean anything. Roose however actually repeats this when he betrays Robb. It was him being cruel, Yes I had Jaime and let him go, yes I sided with the Lannisters. The unfortunate part of this though is that Catelyn having freed Jaime personally, hears this remarks and dies thinking he was behind The Red Wedding. When she returns as Lady Stoneheart she surely remembers it. And poor Jaime, having worked so hard to redeem himself, can very well be done in by something he likely doesn't even remember saying, and surely meant nothing by. But it's basically his chickens coming home to roost, he's put out do much negativity that even though now that he's changed that negativity is bound to be his undoing. It's one of those things. Forget your jacket, catch a cold, and somebody calls you Snot Boogie, and your Snot Boogie for life.

Despite his invocation of socialist principles, Wang was quick to tell me that he dislikes the New Left label, even though he has used it himself. "Intellectuals reacted against 'leftism' in the 80's, blaming it for all of China's problems," he said, "and right-wing radicals use the words 'New Left' to discredit us, make us look like remnants from the Maoist days." Wang also doesn't care to be identified with the radical intellectuals of the 60's in America and Europe, to whom the term New Left was originally applied. Many of them, he said, had passion and slogans but very little practical politics, and not surprisingly, more than a few ended up with the neoconservatives, supporting "fantasy projects" like democracy in Iraq.

The promotion for Wrestlemania 28 was centered around "Once in a Lifetime", the tagline for the main event match pitting the current generation's poster boy, John Cena, against the golden ticket of yesteryear and A-List movie star, The Rock. It wasn't difficult to see how this angle was a winner for WWE, and was reminiscent of a similar concept 11 years earlier featuring The Rock and Hulk Hogan. Last year's build-up was entertaining indeed, but the match itself left something to be desired. Ultimately, it was a nice little ride but we were glad when it was over.

Back in the day when "a man who, beyond the age of 26, finds himself on a bus can count himself a failure" ( Margaret Thatcher, 1986 ), a man who found himself on a bicycle must have really felt at the bottom of the economic hierarchy.  These days bicycles are more likely to be associated with aspiring Prime Ministers ( both of them ), Lord Sugar and the affluent classes, not to mention the well-documented rise of the monied MAMIL and the migration of the golf set on to two wheels . Perhaps this has helped to bring about a perception that people cycle out of choice and not necessity; that their journeys could be easily supplanted with a trip by car or on the Tube if conditions are unfavourable; but as cycling rates grow in London so will the profile of its cyclists and we could soon find ourselves with a new "cycling tribe"; one that is very poor indeed. This week sees the overhaul of England's social welfare system and unless you've been living under a rock you won't have been able to escape all of the media chatter about benefits and the so-called bedroom tax.  In the coming years poorer people within our society are likely to find themselves initially less well off; its claimed that inner city poorer people will move to cheaper suburban areas and poorer people with limited mobility already living in suburban areas could have to give up running a car .  Government minister Iain Duncan Smith may think it is possible to live off £53 a week , but most people would struggle and be looking to make economies where it is possible.  With diesel fuel currently costing around £1.40p a litre and a one day Zone 1-4 Transport for London Travelcard coming in at £11, or £43.50 for a week, the bicycle makes the most sensible choice for people with decreasing incomes to get around.

Ivan Abadjiev, the great Bulgarian weightlifting coach made the world take notice when his team started dominating Olympic contests and international meets during the prime of his coaching career. What was the secret to his success? Increasing the annual training volume of the contest lifts with his athletes in training. The Bulgarian training regime for weightlifters is legendary. Multiple sessions per day, six days per week with athletes working up to daily maxes in all their big lifts. The relatively small country of Bulgaria was outpacing the Soviet Union, which had a much larger population and the most advanced training based science on the planet at that time. Abadjiev demonstrated with clarity and certainty that attacking specificity with a volume based approach was the most dominant methodology for developing weightlifters.

Canadian Grand Prix cancelled for 2004: official
Under heavy police guard, Mahmoud Mansour and Morel Malka held their wedding celebration last evening in Rishon Letzion. Mansour, a young Muslim man and Malka, who was born Jewish and converted to Islam, were surrounded by security guards as they arrived at the Shemesh Aduma (Red Sun) wedding hall. Outside, about 150 meters away from the entrance to the hall at the end of the street, some 200 right-wing protesters demonstrated against what they called "assimilation in the Holy Land." A counter-demonstration was held by the entrance to the hall.
In captivity, tortoises often grow faster than their conspecifics in the wild. Here, we document growth (measured as change in body mass) in three individual Geochelone sulcata over an exceptionally long period of nearly 18 years and use growth data (measured as change in carapace length) from the literature on free-ranging animals for comparison. Body lengths almost reached a plateau in the animals due to the long observation period. After transformation of body length to body mass for data from wild animals, logistic growth curves were successfully fitted to all data. The resulting functions yielded a 1.4–2.6 times higher intrinsic growth rate in captive than in wild individuals. The logistic growth model estimated the inflexion point of the growth curve at 6–9 years for the captive animals. This coincided with age at sexual maturity, respectively observations of first egg-laying of a female and the masturbation of a male. The inflexion point of the growth curve for free-ranging individuals was estimated at 15 years. Raising tortoises on intensive feeding regimes in captivity may considerably shorten generation times during the breeding stage of restocking programmes, and slow-growing animals are more likely to thrive after release into the wild. Investigations on the health of offspring from fast-growing parents are lacking.

"ASL is visual literature, meaning stories are preserved and passed down from generation to generation by the act of signed storytelling instead of spoken or written down. ASL is not a written language but this is not an uncommon occurrence in the world. Languages that do not have a written form produce a specific type of literature called "oral literature." This is true of ASL, the tradition of passing on stories in the Deaf community relies on the act of live storytelling. ASL was originally captured on film in 1913 by the National Association of the Deaf (NAD). ASL literature is currently being preserved by video recordings in order to preserve the creativity and beauty of the language.

In "Prayers for Bobby," Mary Griffith (Sigourney Weaver) is a devout Christian who raises her children with the conservative teachings of the Presbyterian Church. However, when her son Bobby (Ryan Kelley) confides to his older brother he may be gay, life changes for the entire family after Mary learns about his secret. While Bobby's father (Henry Czerny) and siblings slowly come to terms with his homosexuality, Mary believes God can cure him of what she considers his 'sin' and persuades Bobby to pray harder and seek solace in church activities in hopes of changing him. Desperate for his mother's approval, Bobby does what is asked of him, but through it all, the church's apparent disapproval of homosexuality causes him to grow increasingly withdrawn and depressed. Guilty over the pain he is causing Mary, Bobby moves away, yet hopes that some day his mother will accept him. His subsequent depression and self-loathing intensifies as he blames himself for not being the 'perfect' son and is driven to suicide. Faced with their tragedy, Mary begins to question her faith when she receives no answers from her pastor concerning her devastating loss. Through her long and emotional journey, Mary slowly reaches out to the gay community and discovers unexpected support from a very unlikely source. The film is based on the 1995 Leroy Aarons book of the same name.

Microsoft is rebooting Windows Phone again. After years in purgatory and a Nokia acquisition that didn't exactly lead to anything major, we now have two Lumia phones that are trying it all again: the Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL. Both were oft-leaked devices — so much so that we came into this event already knowing the big points. They're running a version of Windows 10, which Microsoft is betting will help jump-start their third-party app ecosystems. They have the same basic specs we've seen on a lot of phones lately: Qualcomm Snapdragon processors of varying strength depending on the phone size, plenty of RAM, 32GB of storage, USB Type-C, and your choice of two pretty large screens. Hell, Microsoft even says that they're liquid cooled, which is crazy.

These are the facts. At some point, someone somewhere in the US government had an amazing idea: why not build a compressed natural gas (CNG) filling station in Afghanistan? Forty-three million taxpayer dollars later, the city of Sheberghan, in the far north of the country, got its gas station. But, according to the watchdog agency probing Afghanistan reconstruction spending, nobody seems to know — or wants to admit — who signed off on the project or how its costs spiraled so completely out of control.

Recent studies have found a significant association between PTSD and low heart rate variability (HRV), a biomarker of autonomic dysregulation. Research indicates that respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) biofeedback increases HRV while reducing related pathological symptoms. This controlled pilot study compared RSA biofeedback to progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) as adjunctive interventions for 38 persons with PTSD symptoms in a residential treatment facility for a substance use disorder. Both groups were assessed at pre-intervention and 4-week post-intervention. Group x time interactions revealed significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms and increases in HRV indices for the RSA group. Both groups significantly reduced PTSD and insomnia symptoms and a statistical trend was observed for reduced substance craving for the RSA group. Increases in HRV were significantly associated with PTSD symptom reduction. Overall, these results provide preliminary support for the efficacy of RSA biofeedback in improving physiological and psychological health for individuals with PTSD.

Some people have excessive and unrealistic worries about their health. They are very worried about getting a disease or are certain they have a disease, even after medical tests show they do not. And these people often misinterpret minor health problems or normal body functions as symptoms of a serious disease. An example is a person who is sure that her headaches are caused by a brain tumor. This condition used to be called hypochondria. Now it is called somatic symptom disorder. The symptoms associated with somatic symptom disorder are not under the person's voluntary control, and they can cause great distress and can interfere with a person's life.

Contract your abs as you execute this movement and hold for a second at the top. Tip: As you perform the motion, the lower legs (calves) should always remain parallel to the floor. Return to the starting position as you inhale. Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.

For Earth's first 4 billion years of existence, light and dark followed a predictable 24-hour cycle. Across an ever-increasing amount of Earth's surface, that's no longer the case.

I think the idea of a plastic -- moisture-proof, bug-proof, etc. -- container for storing the artificial Christmas tree is genius. Especially useful as the original box the tree came in starts to fall apart. I have a 7 - 7.5 foot pre-lit tree that breaks down into 3 sections with branches that fold up. Reading the information about this container convinced me that it would be large enough to store this tree. Well, in order to get the tree into the box, I had to first tie each section tightly to try to compress the branches. It was still to large to be able to put the lid on the box, but with pushing and shoving and the use of lots of duct tape, I was able to get the tree in the box. I think there was one box that was larger, but by the time I made my purchase that one was gone. Seasonal merchandise, so when it's gone, it's gone :-( I would still recommend this product though because I think it is a good storage option. Just don't expect it to be a good fit for a large or very full tree.
